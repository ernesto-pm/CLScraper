Hello,

Hello,

I am seeking a programmer with strong WordPress experience. I specialize in assisting realtors with their marketing and web needs. It is starting to hit the busy season and I need someone to help with overflow work. This could develop into something more consistent and ongoing if things go smoothly. 

This is perfect for someone who might be a freelancer and is looking for more work. You must have your own computer as all of the work is remote and preferably skype to conduct meetings over. 

If you are interested please email me with your resume / experience, hourly asking price, sample work, and please put green chile in the subject line to weed out spam. To also clarify, I am not seeking a company or team but an individual.

I need an ASP.NET SPA application using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It needs to allow a user to take a picture with their camera or to select an image. Once an image is chosen, the user needs to be able to crop the image. The image size needs to be reduced to 1024x768, at the max. Once the image is cropped and the size reduced, it needs to be passed to a Web API call. The Web API call will need to pass the image data over to ABBYY Business Card OCR. Once the XML data is returned, it will need to be parsed, and then returned to and populated onto an Edit form.

Hello,

I run a small web design business composed of freelancers, and I am looking for a backend developer (MUST BE LOCAL) to partner with. 

As a first-item agenda, I have a new client who needs help with the development portion of their website, which involves a complex integration with their internal management system, etc -- processing orders, marketing, managing product inventory, etc. I need someone who can be on-site with them to help evaluate dev strategy, scope things out, etc. Someone who is comfortable with databases, Wordpress/Drupal (we'll need to recommend which platform works better for them), and more complex programming in general.

Long-term, I am looking for someone who can assist me with these types of complex projects on a gig-by-gig basis. My background is primarily in design and front-end dev, so I'm looking for someone I can trust to help scope out more complex projects and fulfill their needs as required. In other words, an additional member to my team!

Thank you for taking the time to review our listing. Cuckhoo National Web Design & Internet Marketing is coming to your city and wants you to join our team! 

Cuckhoo is a fun, energetic, goal oriented, organized Web Design & Internet Markerting company which was founded by a small business owner who was tired of being taken advantage of by ""web guys"" who were selling waste and under achieving, all while charging ridiculous prices. 

Cuckhoo offers small business owners true value; we offer them what is needed to provide their customers with a professional online presentation and the search results, which will get them calls while avoiding waste at all costs. 

Cuckhoo's services honestly will sell themselves as long as the presentation of hard facts is done correctly, we are not car salesman and are not pressuring any business owner into anything nor even talking about the first page of Google even though that is all we do. We are there to help and that's it. Business owners are hounded daily and the majority of what they are being hounded for is mostly beneficial to the sales person, not the small business owner. Cuckhoo stops that now. 

When Cuckhoo approaches or is contacted by a client, we review what their true needs are based on the industry their business represents. We look at what the business is currently doing, we offer our professional feedback and then set a plan with goals to be achieved.

Here is an example of our common fellow business owner's needs. . .

Cuckhoo will do the review of the business, it will have some online presence or none but neither will be benefitting them in any way. Cuckhoo takes into consideration that this business owner has already spent thousands and thousands of dollars on waste with other ""web guy"" so lets drop our price, give them value and stop wasting their time. Everything Cuckhoo does for the business owner is theirs, we setup up their hosting account for them, under their name and they own everything. 

Here are their average needs to start off: 
•	Web Hosting (We setup using their credit card and all work goes into this hosting account leaving the owner with value.) 
•	Web Address/Domain Selection (So many business owners make their web address www.johnspizza.com but that is not what we want as the web address which Google reads, we want www.PizzaNYC.com or something similar, we want the top service and the top area in that address but we will also use www.johnspizza.com but it will be what the business uses as its marketing web address as it does help for branding.) 
•	5-10 Page Modern Responsive Website (Home, About, Services, Testimonials, Portfolio, Blog, Contact) 
•	New or Updated Digitalization of Logo
•	Professional Email (Included in their hosting, we create email accounts and assist them with setup on devices getting them a much more professional presentation over the @ msn, gmail, yahoo and aol.) 
•	Abandoned Online Accounts (Cuckhoo will find them and with the customers approval we will gain access, update all and point everything towards the new online presentation.)
•	Creation of all top social media accounts, accurately setup and fully informative. 
•	Google (We do all of the tasks which nobody knows about, we create the Google local listing on maps, Google Analytics for tracking of visitors and all the needed info to help us improve our online marketing plan, Google Webmasters which helps us get quality page rank on Google.)

Full customer review of all tasks and we do not take final payment unless they are satisfied.) 

•	Here is what their average needs are to grow their new online presentation:
•	Maintenance (When you plant a tree, do you water and fertilize it? Well if you don't maintain a website it will break into pieces and honestly die. )
•	Search Engine Optimization, SEO (SEO is king in 2016. It is 100% what you need to do to get your business online, found and in the higher page ranks for search engines. There 100 tasks which need to be completed, without boring the business owner the hard facts are that without Maintenance and SEO the site will go down and will no longer be found as their competitors are always on their tails trying to get in front of them!) 
•	Social Media Management (Our Team posts content which is relative to the industry of the business and anything news related which could be spun)
•	Blog Posts (Nobody cares about a small town pizza place's blog, but Google does and it's a key tool to improving page rank for a new website.) 
•	Customer Contact Assistance (Business owners are busy, after creating their new online presentations they are not as responsive as they need to be when a potential customer contacts them, so we track all and contact the customer that they have a new lead which needs immediate attention. Making sure that every lead is taken full advantage of.) 

The missing piece will be you, the middle man or women growing their own book of business in your city and surrounding areas helping Cuckhoo spread the word which is that Value Is Here, Forget The Waste! There are 2 options for you when it comes to helping Cuckhoo gain more business, you can be an affiliate or a sales person. The difference in value is signifant but the amount of time is also significant. An affiliate gets 10% of the total sales total and is paid upon completion of the project. The sale person gets 25% of the total agreement value and is also paid upon completion. But the sales person also gets residuals. They get 10% of any monthly services for as long as the customer is working with Cuckhoo. We have an almost perfect retention rate so any residual income should be considered good as gold as long as you are servicing the customer perfectly which is what every team member strives for daily. 

If you are thinking this is just another commission position you need to go back to the top of the page and start reading this listing all over again. We are targeting your area for a reason; there is PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY for you. . . 

Breakdown Of Goals for 5 months/ 150 days months excluding bonus structure: 
30 Days $2125.00 Per Month (Based on 5 new average customers obtained)
60 Days $3225.00 Per Month (Based on 7 new average customers obtained + residuals)
90 Days $4850.00 Per Month (Based on 10 new average customers obtained + residuals)
120 Days $7475.00 Per Month (Based on 15 new average customers obtained + residuals)
150 Days $10,350.00 Per Month (Based on 20 new average customers obtained + residuals)

The above numbers are before tax and are obtainable. The question is how good are you and how hungry are you? 


Over 50% of the businesses in your area don't have a website or are barely online. They need to know that they need Cuckhoo and Cuckhoo will do the rest. 

This is truly a very exciting opportunity, Cuckhoo is slowly working itself nationwide and will achieve all goals, which we have set for ourselves, Cuckhoo will be a quality work environment where you can create the quality of life which many strive for daily. Within the next 18 months Cuckhoo will be ranked as one of the best new National Web Firms to work at and for! 

Wanna know more?

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton).

Do you want to learn all the ins and outs of starting a business? Are you graduating or looking for a summer internship? Vip Solutions is an emergency preparedness and home independence consultation company this is going to launch in July. Vip Solutions has been in the works for over 6 years now, and we need an innovative, creative, hardworking individual that is passionate about emergency preparedness and sustainable living to help take it to the next level. 

Check out our prototype website at vipprepared.com for more information

Internship would last from March until June-July, and would put you first in line to be hired for a managerial position after we launch. (We will be hiring around 5 people when we launch)

My business partner is a world-renowned doctor from Ann Arbor who runs an innovative holistic clinic. He would be willing to write an exceptional recommendation letter, if you were indeed, exceptional. If you are really good, there would be opportunities to be paid during the internship, and even acquire a percentage of the company for some sweat-equity on your part. If you can write code and or have any knowledge of web development/design, that would be even better. 

The more creative you are, the more fun we will have. 

A UofM student/ graduate would be ideal. Both my business partner and I earned a degree from the U.

Here is what I am looking to do. I am looking to build a team. I am in need of someone who can build websites, and I am also looking for someone who can get ranking on the search engines. If one can do both that's fine too. 

I am only interested in local people. What i mean by local is within reasonable driving distance.
I have been ripped off way to many times. I am slowly learning valuable lessens, or should I say expensive lessens. 

I am also only interested in ones who are willing to work as a long term team, building a business venture together as partners. If your looking for a quick pay for a small gig this is not for you. Been there done that. I get ripped off every time. 

With that said here is what I need built. 

I am involved with an exclusive trading group, we earn for ourselves on average about 1% a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. This is huge! 

Not only does that equal 365% gains a year, but its actually better than that because of compounding techniques. 

I invite people to this group though webinars. 
there is a $97 fee, people are eager to pay this to join this group. 
Quality stock pics will cost you $100 a month. With no guarantee of gains. You still have to know how to get in and get out profitable. 

If we put 100 people in a virtual room your cut would be $2,367.50 as a 3 person team. We can do this once a week if we can reach that many people on a weekly basses. Everyone is looking for a way to increase there income and this is a no brainier. 

I need a website that of course will market (tell and sell) the investment group and can also register people and take payments, send reminders and what-not. We can discus this more in depth later. 

I also trade my own account on the side and would someday like to offer an alert service. Once we get the one going we can venture into the other. 

Besides the website we will need someone who knows how to get the website ranked so people can find it. 

I also have a refund that I offer people. Once the webinar is over the participants are offered a 100% refund. Those who decide this is not for them with the click of a mouse I refund them there money. 
This is all on the up and up. This is a legal legitimate trading group, incorporated and in business since 2007. We trade stocks, forex, commodities, and web adds.

The picks provided are verification of my earnings. 
the withdrawable gains circled in red in the one pic are gains for this current month of March.

I have told a select few my ideas for the website and they are all excited about the potentional of what this website will become. Like I said I have the vision and ideas to make this idea become a reality but the only thing I'm missing is a web designer to create the website for me. 
This can work two ways....

I can bring a lot of traffic to this website with all the people I know through networking. I just need someone that has the knowledge to build a website and keep it maintenanced and I will help add alot of content to it.
I will tell you the vision I have after we talk on the phone and come to a understanding of what direction we both want to go into as a team to build this business.

Once I find the web designer I'm looking for I will delete this post. Thanks

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker but any that lets
you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards.

I built my own site, and launched it - it's a music blog. Since the launch, I've been working to redesign it. Everything on the site works as it should; however, as a novice at web design, I totally overlooked the issue of cross-browser compatibility and cross-monitor/platform compatibility, not to mention portable devices. I've tried figuring out how to make it look uniform on laptops, desktops with different monitor sizes and other browsers, but still can't get it to work. Looking for someone who could make it look the same on any device and across the three major browsers.

So you want to work from home and stay home with the kids to take care of your family while making enough money to support your family right?

From LOTS of stay at home moms and dads, to retired folks and even weekend warriors are able to work from home because it's a simple fact that there is NO selling involved in what I do at home.

After 9 years in sales and marketing let me fill you in on my personal experiences to keep you from making the same mistakes. . .. & then I want to tell you what HAS worked. Fair enough? Most people spend YEARS AND YEARS learning in trial and error what I'm about to tell you.

If you're just getting started in working at home or you've done it a hundred times and you're looking for something that FINALLY works. Send me an email and get in touch with me so we can get started asap.

•	Have you tried the latest big pizaz thing that's hit the market called blogging?
•	If you know nothing about the cost (which can get pricey) or the how-to's of building a website, how to drive traffic (without spending money to buy it) and how to correctly set up a page to KEEP traffic on your site to BUILD your audience then I wouldn't recommend this because I've done it.
•	Here's an internet fact: over 585 new websites are built every single day! Add in the fact that over 87% of people use their mobile device to access the internet, which should tell you that if your webpage is not set up correctly to be mobile friendly, you're losing out on 87% of potential business. That's a lot of competition to keep up with when you're trying to get traffic and attention to your content.
•	Have I built a blog and made money? Yes. Is it enough to be a source of supplemental income? No. My blog is more of a source of information and entertainment.


•	Have you tried selling items door to door for a big or small company?
•	I have. I had a Kirby vacuum for a year and a half before I went to work for the company and I still have it, I love that thing. I'm a clean freak and a neat nick, but when I went to work for the company realizing just how FAR I had to bend my own morals to try to make a sale (which I didn't make a single sale cuz I always felt guilty) I ended up having to walk away from that sales gig cuz I wasn't going to make a paycheck if I always felt guilty scamming people out of THOUSANDS of dollars for something that didn't cost ANY WHERE NEAR what they list the prices at.
•	Which by the way, made me feel very cheated myself after going to work for that company and realizing just how bad I got jacked to paying for that thing.


•	Have you bought any of those ads you see online that say, ""this program is turn-key"" and works with ""a click of a mouse"" cuz ""any idiot can do it"" and you'll make 6 figures a year.
•	Yea, well the only figures I was left making were figures of debt. Spending out more and more on some (admittedly) very good sales pitches that were all too convincing, but in the end I was left as the idiot who ""conveniently"" could not for the life of me find the refund button on that 30 day money back guarantee (that didn't exist).


•	Have you been charmed by a snake charmer into one of those ""at home work"" programs that tell you how, ""you can make 6 figures a year if you join my company and build your own downline"" with our product line.
•	This has been done to me with Herbalife and believe me, there are just some people who are only after recruits & to get as many people signed up as they can, as quickly as they can with a high sign up fee to get that bonus in their paycheck rather than teaching them to be successful when it comes to that kind of business, which is a PYRAMID SCHEME!


•	Have you tried to write a book and publish it through Amazon on Kindle Direct Publishing and other sites to make the ""big bucks"" that (the few) are making off just a few books that they've written that are selling like mad as they talk about the $10K that they make each month?
•	I've done this, though the book I was writing was more for my own entertainment (and took over a year to write) which I wrote just because I could and it was fun, not really for the money, though if I could make a living from it would been nice. What most people don't know is that you have to make a minimum of $100 in profit before you can cash out on a single dime of commission that you made, which for my own book could be a while unless I spend out boo-koo bucks to market and advertise it.
•	Have I made money from that book? Yes. Is it enough to be a supplemental income, much less a bit of play money? No.


•	Have you tried a freelancing gig on Fiverr?
•	For the first 6 months that I'd been on Fiverr I'd make about $20 per month. Is there money to be made? Yes. Have I made money online working at home with Fiverr? Yes. Is it enough to be a supplemental income to support my family? No. Not unless I spend boo-koo bucks to market my skills and (again, just like a website) drive traffic to my Fiverr page to make more sales in order to make more money, which in turn, that money would then be spent on marketing my Fiverr page to make more sales, and it's just a vicious circle from there on.


•	What about the at home program called Arbitrage Underdog? Heard of that one?
•	It's about a $40 program, where if you get the upgraded version for $80 there's bonus features which will make the job simpler for you. Basically, this program will scan Craigslist for key words that you type in. For me I used 'web design'.
•	I've built and designed quite a few websites, (though wordpress is free and I just stick with that cuz it's free and simple to use, but I've also built a $600 website before as well, which at the end of the day wasn't worth the .10 cents that I made from it.) Pretty well, with this program you're looking for 2 people. Person A wants to build a website for their company or interest & person B (on Fiverr) has the knowledge and skill base to build the site. Person A (on Craigslist) is willing to pay $250 for a ""cheep"" website, while person B (on Fiverr) can do it for $5. So you as the middle man connect the dots between person A and person B keeping the money in the middle making a $245 profit.
•	Sounds great right? I did this for 6 weeks and only sold one website that I build myself, (mostly because I didn't quite trust the person I found on Fiverr to do the job even with high ratings cuz I wanted to deliver a quality job. Yes I promised a customer something and felt obligated to follow through with what I said I would do. It's called a moral ethic, which I wish more people had).




Have you heard enough yet? Convinced yet? I've been at this for a long time and I've learned a lot. The most valuable and important thing that I've learned is that when it comes to being successful, 80% of people fail because they are taught to fail! While the other 20% of people that try are the successful few.


We're led to believe by mass media that only 1% of the population is earning 99% of the money and they even state this in the movie called, ""The Secret"" which yes I've seen it a hundred times and I do love that movie but I think some of their information is wrong.

Here's a fact that masses of people DON'T KNOW, cuz it's a hazard for you to know AT ALL!

1 OUT OF EVERY 1,000 PEOPLE IS A MILLIONAIRE!!!

That's right. You've got a better shot at becoming a millionaire with just a little bit of elbow grease than you do at winning the jack pot in the lottery. You might live next door to one and not even know it. There are LOTS of people who make BIG money that don't want the fame and spotlight and to be publicly known, usually for good reason!

So to be up front with you, cuz I like to be honest with people (it settles better with my conscience this way so I can sleep at night) let's ask the question . . . can you make money from home?

YES! YES! & YES!

Have I done it on multiple occasions? YES!

Would you like to know what I do? YES!

Alright I'm getting a little excited for you and thinking out loud for you . . .. I'll try to calm down.

Now with the 80/20 rule where 80% of people have a tendency to fail and there's a 20% success rate it's just a mathematically proven fact that I cannot change and probably will not change no matter how hard I try, BUT for anyone who wants to avoid spending out the THOUSANDS of dollars that I've forked out to try to work at home, and the COUNTLESS HOURS I've spent to make a few measly dollars


With the 9 years of sales and marketing experience I have in my hands to give to you, I want to teach you to be successful. One of the things that you'll have to have to start is $29 to get in and I do all the one-on-one training with you for free!

Yes I'm going to be up front with you and tell you that it is going to cost $29. So is that $29 the best $29 I spent back in 2014 when I started? Yes.

So why am I offering to train you and teach you EVERYTHING I KNOW for FREE? Cuz I'd personally like to see more people actually get what they want and have the kind of life that they want without having to jump through all the hoops and cry all those tears of failure that I did when I got scammed time and time again. Through all the stress and all the pain and all the worry, life is hard enough without feeling like we're at war with the rest of the world.

What I enjoy doing for a living is helping people and inspiring others to feel empowered. So let me empower you to make a change, and inspire you with hope in getting back to feeling like your home is your sanctuary rather than a fox hole in the middle of a war zone.

I like to call myself a Professional Instigator. lol, it just sounds good. The best part is that you wont even have to sell any thing to any one. I tell people what I do, what I'm about, what company I'm with & everyone instantly wants to become a part of what I do.

If you're just getting started in working at home or you've done it a hundred times and you're looking for something that FINALLY works. Send me an email and get in touch with me so we can get started asap. 

yes you will be dealing with and being trained by a LIVE person (ie; me) not dealing with a confusing automated system that you have to try to figure out. I'm here to answer questions and help you make a living.

Hey there,

I am in the conceptual stage of a web site startup and will start by divulging two very important facts that will likely weed out many who read this:

1) I have zero website development knowledge/experience (Weebly is about as far as I've come, used as a brainstorm platform)

2) This is (at first) an unpaid position that, for the right individual, will still be seen as a valuable investment of their time; one that could likely turn into a paid position/partnership when the site gets to the point of launch and is able to be presented in regards to the acquisition of investment funds for growth. 

3) I'm not necessarily looking for a seasoned industry vet but rather anyone that has the capabilities/resources to consider dabbling in this project with me.

4) I know my case is essentially a dime a dozen (confirmed by some feedback in a couple responses) and only expect someone to consider this project IF they find the heart of it intriguing - not if they are just looking for a 'new' project or side project to fill some time. 

With all of that said, my web-based concept will provide a very simple solution to a nuisance/problem/cost experienced by a wide range of individuals (especially the initial target demographic). The reason someone with no internet/computer background is getting into this industry is due to a 'light bulb' moment I had last summer that sparked a flurry of brainstorming to solve a problem that came up during my recent travels. The value of this concept will be most easily understood by someone who enjoys outdoor recreation, travel, action sports, etc. A business plan is in the works and a handful of investors within my network have expressed interest in seeing the final proposal.

I am looking for someone to help turn what is currently on paper into a viable 'prototype' site that can be used to a.) generate initial interest, user counts and feedback and b.) pitch the concept to those that have the funds to enable us to take the site/company to the next level. If you think you might be that person and you have a few hours per week to put into an exciting/fun project that has great potential, I would love to speak with you. I'm happy to hear from anyone who is in NH or in any other state for that matter - this isn't something that necessarily has to be discussed/worked on in person.

If interested please provide:

- Some basic info about yourself and your hobbies (like I said, I want the right person to work on this project and that person is one who shares the same interests as myself and my target demographic).

- Experience (school, training, certifications, etc.)

- Portfolio (links to sites you've built or helped to create)

- Favorite National Park/Forest (or the next one on your list to visit) - why?

Lastly, you would be required to sign an NDA before any further details would be divulged.

If you've made it this far down the post, thanks for your interest!

Science & Engineering Fair Online Systems (SEFOS) - Addressing a Global Challenge in Science Fair Management Supporting Student Research & Innovation

Project Scope of Work
MSSEF seeks experienced web-based software programmers to help improve and maintain SEFOS, a unique online management system for science fair organizations. Launched in Massachusetts, SEFOS is hosted on Acquia, and candidates will need experience in the latest versions of Drupal, PhP and MySQL. The existing coding is customized and mostly in views. Anticipated are 4-6 hours per month on average year-round, and 40-60 hours in the two-month period of April/May. 

SEFOS is designed as a global model, and the current phase of work involves a combination of maintenance projects, development projects to improve/expand the software, Skype meetings, and 2-3 on-site meetings each year, including one two-day event at MIT in Cambridge, MA. Future phases of SEFOS will expand use of SEFOS in Massachusetts and then nationally.

What is SEFOS?
Science Fair program administration is a complex process that involves multiple stakeholders, including students, teachers, judges, science fair directors and staff. SEFOS creates a paperless environment and automates labor-intensive processes, enabling integration and data flow between separate components in a secure data environment. 

SEFOS is far more than a typical ""events program"" -- it involves review and approvals of students' research plans based on scientific and safety guidelines, and state laws. SEFOS also involves matching of hundreds of project topics each year with the expertise of a thousand judges' expertise. SEFOS maintains databases of thousands of accounts for students, teachers and judges (that grows each year), and provides tiered levels of access by administrators. Built into SEFOS are benchmark rules established by the International Science & Engineering Fair. Using these benchmarks, SEFOS provides participating students with an online wizard so they can easily figure out which research forms are required for their specific projects. SEFOS automates key processes -- from entry of judges' scores to matching of student preferences & scores with over $500,000 in annual awards and scholarships. SEFOS also produces a printed program book that includes student abstracts and affiliations, a script for the culminating awards ceremony, and printing of badges and certificates. Each year, SEFOS generates 75 reports in a very time-sensitive 2-day period for MSSEF.

About MSSEF:
The Massachusetts State Science & Engineering Fair, Inc.(MSSEF) is dedicated to developing future thought leaders through experiences in science and engineering practices, using well-proven programs and novel approaches that empower students and educators in and beyond the classroom. For 67 years MSSEF programs have successfully advanced science literacy and inspired new generations of science, technology and engineering leaders. Founded in 1949 by American Academy of Arts & Sciences, MSSEF enables thousands of students each year to delve deeply into the professional practices of working scientists and engineers through development of independent research projects guided by teachers or mentors. MSSEF showcases and celebrates students' research work through annual statewide Science Fair events for middle and high school students. MSSEF supports schools statewide to start/expand science fairs and empowers teachers with tools, resources and professional development so that their students can better understand their world, learn to think independently and critically, and help to solve everyday as well as global challenges.

This website is 90% finished: http://www.workexcel.mybigcommerce.com/?ctk=S/YwgF8JHtmOEtB2rLOL9catWH5RQK65bM4ICAKeKIlC7HM57Q - When it goes live, it will replace WorkExcel.com and WorkExcel.corecommerce.com (These latter two sites are to be shut down for various reasons--not updateable, not as versatile, not as good, and look bad.) The new site above is a bigcommerce.com hosted site. I need a Webmaster or developer to help me get all the redirects correct from these two other sites, resolve hard coded links shared between these three sites that are associated with ftp://eaptools.com and ftp://workexcel.corecommerce.com and workexcel.net, and html built pages using http://workexcel.corecommerce.com. I then need to have you or someone else make the new WorkExcel.com google-efficient. I have an older website I call workexcel.net. It was my very first website and it has many ranking pages, so I fear turning it off because I have landing pages I have build that I do not have time to recreate them at this moment. So, I am keeping it turned on, but hope to eventually get it shut down too if I can get http://www.workexcel.mybigcommerce.com/?ctk=S/YwgF8JHtmOEtB2rLOL9catWH5RQK65bM4ICAKeKIlC7HM57Q this site bringing in the ton of traffic like it should be bringing in! -- especially since I have a ton of content and a web presence for over 15 years. I also own workplacenewsletters.com and handoutsplus.com which were attempts silo products and increase sales, but I still am not succeeding growing my business back to where it was in 2011 (Gross Sales $322,000). Now my sales about $200,000 but the Web sites are only bringing in 20-30K per year. They used be $100-125K, but they really should be $300K. I really need a full time Web master but I cannot get one until I bridge these problems above. So, I need to have you grab this project, help me 301 redirect pages (probably 1500 urls), fix dead links, and get me smooth sailing, and turn off the other sites. So you need good SEO experience, developer skills, etc.

Hello -

First, this is a real posting by a real person. My name is Ben, and I am in the works for starting up a high-end architectural products company online.

Basically, I am looking for someone to collaborate with on how to implement custom headers/footers and templates overall for selling my products.

I managed an eCommerce site for the same type of products for another company, but now I'd like to branch off and do it myself here in Charlotte. I have seen how successful the building industry is right now, and am looking for someone who would like to partner up and put our heads together to start this new venture. Many of the products can be purchased directly online, but some of the products need to be showcased online (but customers would call in to request a quote). I have the connections with the manufacturers to promote and sell these products - I just need someone to collaborate with on quickly and efficiently get this company up online with what I envision.

So, mainly this posting is for someone who already has their own income but who would just like to get together and make this happen. What I could offer would be a percentage of the online sales that come in. So, although I wouldn't be paying you anything initially, once the orders start flowing in, you would receive the percentage we discuss. 

If you are interested in getting together for a coffee to discuss, please get in touch. I've seen how successful this eCommerce business has been for another company and want to do it myself. These are high-end building products - and not just $10 arts and crafts products. If you're willing to put forth a little of your time and effort, this will end up being beneficial to you. Also, this is not a pyramid scheme. This is selling products directly online to the consumer. I have the products to sell - I just need help with the web customization portion.

Please be qualified and knowledgeable in eCommerce/web design - especially in creating custom headers and footers.

Thank you,

Ben

Hello Craigslist! Thank you for taking the time to read over our job post.

Who We Are

My partner and I are actively seeking someone to help us out with our growing freelance business. He handles the design and front end development while I handle WordPress and more advanced development. We make a fantastic team right now and are looking for someone that can make us even 
better.

Right now our sales are hit and miss. We scour Craigslist and job boards trying to find people that we can help who need new websites. We would like to expand this to actively pursuing small businesses across the midwest that could greatly benefit from a newly redesigned website.

What We're Looking For

We would like to find someone with some sales or marketing experience. We aren't looking for someone who has some free time to just send a few emails. If you have experience with cold calls and cold emails that would be amazing.

Ultimately we are also looking for someone who really fits in well and wants to grow along with us. We don't expect this position to require more than about 4 hours a day. You would check the job boards as well as contact potential clients directly through phone or email.

What We're Offering

Currently since we're only a small freelance business we're only able to offer commission based compensation. This would start at 15%. So if you sell a $3,000 website you'd receive $450. I'm also happy to offer little bonuses for a job well done such as lunches and subscriptions.

If interested feel free to send me an email! Absolutely NO recruiters or teams we are looking for an individual to join us as a team.

I have to collect from a company that owes me money for writing software. I have a lot of questions that I want to ask a lot of lawyers to help me decide what to do.

I have a 2 page description of what happened plus 12 questions. Any way you can get the answers is ok.

1. Email or post to their web site.
2. Call them.
3. Pay them in an on-line system of experts. (Tell me how to pay them.)
4. Visit them in person for a free initial consultation. (Many do that.)

To get them to answer all of the question you probably have to do 2, 3 or 4, but number 1 can get them to call you if you tell them you want to be contacted by phone.

I will pay via PayPal. Tell me how much you want - I am open to suggestion. If you want to just call them for $15 per call, that would be ok. For the first one I'll add $10 for the time it takes you to get started.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker but any that lets
you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards.

I'm looking for a web designer to help me write some custom CSS for a portfolio/cinematography demo reel website (my own). I need someone who has experience in web based video players and customizing their behavior, as most of the site is based on video clips linked to thumbnails

I'm using a pre-existing squarespace template as the main anchor for the site, but I can't get the video functionality to behave quite the way i want it to. 

I'm also open to someone helping me redesign the idea from the ground up, though i figured the job might be shorter and easier if you just took the work that i've already done and customized it to fit my needs and finish the project. 

I'll pay competitive rates, shoot me an email with some examples of sites that you've designed and/or built and we can go from there, i'll send you the link to the site i'm working on and you can tell me how much work and $ you think would be involved

Thanks. Hoping this will be a relatively quick and easy thing as I would love to have this up and running in the next 1-2 weeks (ideally).

Can you write code so fast you make Silicon Valley melt?
Leap through edits like a Gazelle running for its life?
Are you tired of being treated only as the code monkey?
Cringe at poorly written third-party code?
Do you understand design isn't everything?
Do you yearn for being in the background?
Do you enjoy having creative flexibility?
Enjoy the work of a front-end developer?
Do you understand code isn't everything?
You know what GitHub is used for?
Are you dependable?
Do you look for problems to solve instead of waiting for others to solve them?
Are you thee Jack in Jack of all trades?
Want a combination of easy web work, the challenge of continuously improving websites, and creating something out of nothing? What if it was only in the name of making online experiences better?
Want to work on your own time and in your underwear if you choose? Keep reading but understand there's a catch.

Working with a small research and marketing consulting practice that's been in business for 11-years, requires you to be adaptable and able to get things done. There will be a list of things that need to be accomplished but it's your duty to get them done. Turnaround times need to be quick and communication needs to be succinct. To get the job done, you'll have to supply the software, hardware and connectivity to do what you're asked. If you don't read this post thoroughly, hint hint, I will never see your resume. Time is the only true currency and I'm the owner of a small research and marketing practice tied to some of the world's best known marketers.

Some of my colleagues are world renowned. They helped Best Buy turn their world around in the early 2000's. One has placed over 78 books on national bestsellers lists. Some of their own books are New York Times Best Sellers. Two consult a company that rhymes with oogle (yeah, that company). But what's most impressive is our ability to grow small owner operated businesses with smaller budgets than the other guys. I'm talking of growth like 7%, 21%, 73%, 104% year-over-year. And what's even more magical is there are over 5.91-million small businesses in the United States and there are only 47 of us. But for now what matters is there is only 1 of me and I can't give my own clients everything they deserve.

Eventually this will become a retainer-based gig. For now it's work-for-hire but with loyalty. I can't promise a certain number of hours a week. What I will say is some weeks you may see an hour worth of work while other weeks you may experience 18+ hours worth of work. I pay anywhere from $30/hour to $40/hour dependent on your abilities. 

Experience:
Your experience needs to include at least four years worth of Wordpress, graphic design, Google Analytics and AdWords knowledge. If you have experience with IA, UX, CX, CRO or PPC, all the better. You need to be comfortable with cloud based workflows and collaborative tools. Formal education is nice, ability is better. 

Since you'll be working with me as a contractor, I can't legally tell you what software you must use. All I can do is request that you have the ability to connect to servers using sFTP, create graphic designs like it's a dream, have the ability to email. . . all the standard stuff. Me? I'm a Mac person who uses Forklift, TextWrangler, Pages, Numbers, Airmail, ScreenFlow, Dropbox,and 1Password amongst others (1Password being my must have piece of software). But that's just me. 

Nice to Haves:
It'd be nice for you to have an understanding of SEO, SEM, but more importantly an understanding behind the concept of post hoc ergo propter hoc. Most task requests will center on improving websites but other things may creep in. But make no mistake, this is not a full time job. This is contractor work. I want to work with you. I'm not hiring you to be the middle man with someone else. It's just you and me.

I do a lot of experiments, which can be fun, but drama free productivity and on-time deliverables are big priorities. My first focus is always growing my client's business. My second is growing my practice which I hope includes you - someone who's flexible, able to shift gears quickly, knows how to get stuff done, and knows we're in this together.

I value thoroughness and the ability to focus, so I'm putting a special word in this paragraph to weed out sloppy people. Anyone skimming through job descriptions and blindly blasting out resumes won't see it, but you're actually reading this job description, aren't you? Nicely done. Now, make sure you put the word ""#PropterHoc"" in the subject line of your reply and I'll give your resume the same respect you've given this job description. I'll actually read it.

Tasks:
Tasks for a growing practice may require you to be ready to wear multiple hats. If something needs doing, let it be known and volunteer to get it done and at what cost. Pro Tip: never, ever, ever say ""that's not my job"" or ""I thought about that a few weeks ago."" Every now and again you're going to be asked to collaborate with clients and you're going to need to speak their language. You've got to put them at ease with your actions. You've got to become their defacto web person and install and setup things like Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager. You've got to maintain their Wordpress sites and the plugins that go with it. You've got to create landing pages using services like Unbounce and install services like Visual Website Optimizer. You've got to add supplied content into Wordpress or make simple modifications to links and SEO settings. Every now and then you'll be asked to update CSS or create a duplicate page so we can conduct A/B or multivariate tests. And then there will be the creation of new websites and documenting workflows for website launches and other initiatives. But all of this must be done from your perspective of making things great. You're thinking ""that's a lot of stuff!"" Maybe it is but it's there to demonstrate the diverseness of what will scream across your plate.

Qualifications:
Excellent communication skills and the ability to work on your own is a requirement as is the ability to thrive with continuous improvement. You must be highly organized and detail oriented. You can motivate and work autonomously most of the time. You have to be flexible and adaptable with the ability to juggle a variety of client needs.

My practice exists for the David's of the world. For the dreamers. To help small businesses grow faster. Convince me you're willing to tilt your head at windmills and believe in the small guys. Send me links to some of your past work. Tell me about yourself. Please, do not send that impersonal, generic resume you're sending everyone else.

Note: Please read the ad before replying. I have received many texts asking ""What is the job?"" and emails offering irrelevant services. I don't need your SEO, web design, or help finding clients. While I appreciate your creativity, I don't need to be pitched on new services or methods. My existing packages have orders that need to be filled. I have clients already. That why I made this ad!

Gig Description:

Growing white-label social media agency needs social media posters on a per job or monthly contract basis. We sell social media services through other agencies. Their clients need us to provide regular posting on Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest. 

We need some help making social media posts on Facebook and Twitter this month. 

Required Skills:

Write in proper English, with a professional tone. Use correct grammar and spelling.
Detail-oriented but fast worker 
Ability to use a social media posting tool (we use Sendible) to write and edit updates for social media channels
Make use of appropriate text, pictures, links, and other attachments, while constructing posts that fit within allowed character limits
Quickly do basic research on relevant topics (use Google News, social media feeds, Buzzsumo, etc)

Preferred Experiences:

Experience posting and interacting on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and Pinterest
Experience with Hootsuite, Sprout Social, or Sendible. 
Freelance background or mentality- ability to work on your own and set your own hours, work from home and be paid per account

Details on the $25 Gig:

I will pay $25 for completing a short work sample. You will be provided a list of accounts and posts that need to be completed. Updates will be written using our Sendible account and approved or rejected by our account manager. Tutorials are available as needed. I will provide payment via Paypal and feedback upon submission. More work may be offered in the future.

Email to apply or for more info. Please Reply to the ad to email.
Update: Please email so we can communicate clearly. I am getting too many clueless texts. Thanks!

About me/us:

This is NOT an MLM, or some dubious work at home scheme. I have a real small business and I need help. It would be fairly easy for me to find cheap virtual assistants to outsource most of my needs, but I'd rather find local people.

I am an Ohio State graduate, and I live in Columbus with my 2 kids.
I co-founded a small social media agency 3 years ago. My job is providing business social media posting and interaction to other agencies and their clients. I ""white label"" my social media packages to web developers, SEO agencies, and other digital marketing firms. They give me the orders and I fulfill the work. We have set actions and quotas that have to be performed every month to fulfill the contracts. 

We work in volume. In other words, instead of charging $1000s a month and working full-time for a few big companies, we mostly provide small business packages that keep social profiles active on a limited budget. We have a lot of small, local (though not local to here, usually) businesses and ecommerce companies that just need regular social media updates and interaction.

For example, I might need your help posting for a Dentist in Miami, a car mechanic in Cleveland, an online jeweler, a carpet cleaner in Australia, plus 10 or 20 or 50 other types of accounts. You would be paid a monthly per job rate. You would control how and when you do it. I provide access to accounts, social media posting tools and resources, tips, etc. 

It's possible I will need help with interaction, sales, and customer service (mostly email and Skype text chat), too. One person doesn't have to be able to do all of that, but the more flexibility the better. For now it's mostly about getting the core work performed. 

Business has exploded recently, and I'm expecting new orders every week. I have more agencies waiting to talk to me, and if they are serious I will have more work.

I need an ASP.NET SPA application using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It needs to allow a user to take a picture with their camera or to select an image. Once an image is chosen, the user needs to be able to crop the image. The image size needs to be reduced to 1024x768, at the max. Once the image is cropped and the size reduced, it needs to be passed to a Web API call. The Web API call will need to pass the image data over to ABBYY Business Card OCR. Once the XML data is returned, it will need to be parsed, and then returned to and populated onto an Edit form.

We currently process our credit card payments through PayPal on our web site using php.

It's done so the user never leaves the site. We take the cc info, pass it to PayPal via curl and respond appropriately, all within our code.

It works fine.

We now want to add a PayPal button that users may also use to pay so they may have the option of paying over time.

We seek a developer who can write that code for us. We'll call your code with an array (or object if you prefer) with all the order header information. The PayPal cart will not include the items, which should make things a bit simpler. Your code will have placeholders for the PayPalAPIUsername, PayPalAPIPassword, PayPalSignature, and PayPalVersion.

Hello!

We're a small startup that hired someone from overseas to do our project via Freelancer.com - and they either went out of business or just gave up on our website project and took the money and ran :((

So we are looking for someone LOCAL TO COLORADO SPRINGS/DENVER where we can sit down face to face like at Starbucks or whatever to show you exactly what needs to be finished off ... It's only a 2 page website (Age Verification page - then a scrolling info page) ALL DONE IN HTML5 ... so 90% of the work is done - but we never got the final files from them - but thankfully we ran ""site sucker"" on their test-bed before they disappeared and now need someone to take those files and load them and make a few tweaks with content and make sure all the links are solid and works OK on mobile devices and tablets etc.

DO NOT CALL FROM OUTSIDE OF COLORADO -

DO NOT CALL IF YOU ARE A FULL SERVICE WEB COMPANY - 
We are a startup on a very limited budget and simply can't afford your services - as our allotted funds just got taken by that overseas company) - so please don't waste your time or ours.

THE REASON WE ONLY WANT COS/DENVER designers is so we can meet and show you the site map and the layout exactly the way we want it to be - It's impossible to do it via phone/email/Skype - so you must be willing to meet us face to face in a very public area so you know you are safe and secure (and we are too!) - Loads of crazies of Craig's List as we all know - but we are so far behind schedule now - we really need some local talent to help do the last 10%

PAY: We are open to offers - and you can figure out the website URL from our email - as we don't want to collect a bunch of SPAM emails by posting our info publicly here - If you're technical - then you know what we're talking about with site sweepers and Google and such - 

But if you visit our current parked website - you'll see a static image in place of what we need in the end - obviously we have all the files and coding to produce that image and page with most of the coding - but till we're ready to go public, we're only putting that up online along with a 'contact us' link b/c technically we've not re-opened our doors in CO just yet ... We'll need the logo placed properly and some content added on Page 2 that you can't see here online - but will provide all that when we meet - 

Ideally we're looking for a Uni student who wants to pad their Resume and that needs some extra beer or pocket money for fixing our site - Shoot us a price - or call/write and we can go into more detail as to what we need done - and then that'll help you with time and pricing - But whatever we end up doing, we only pay for the finished project, not by the hour .... 

So if this sounds of interest to you - You have our contact info and either ask for Declan or leave a message and someone will get back to you ASAP - 

Thanks! :)

**It is *NOT* OK for others to contact you about other services, products or commercial interests!! Capiche!?!

Do you have your own computer? And, do you speak English well?

Those are the two requirements I'm looking for. I can teach you everything you need to know to not only help me get my work done but also be able to create your own income online.

I need someone to help with work on wordpress, twitter, facebook and website analytics. 

You might only work about 10 hours per week to start as you are trained. If this turns out to be a good fit for both of us your hours and pay will increase. I'm looking to build something long term.

Must be around the DFW area for occasional meetings.

Experience in any of these are a plus:

html, css, webmaster tools, schema, web design, video

Students/Entry Level

We are a small company that makes handmade products utilizing environmentally conscientious & sustainable practices; and we manages and directly sell our goods to the retail market. I have owned several small businesses, and am starting this one here in Ohio after returning from 7 years in New Zealand. I am looking for an intern, or 2. Some paid work will be available, but that is more of a bonus and not the real reason to apply for this position.

An internship with us is flexible and can offer experience in web design, web building, social media marketing, advertising, branding, and you can also be involved in a more general way, with everything that a start up deals with- setting up the operations of a company, sales, products, supply and inventory, shipping & more. 

Unlike many companies, we are not re-sellers, but we make our own product, so you may get to be involved in that process as well, which is one that involves woodworking, staining, painting, fabric and assembly. 

This is not a paid internship, however I am flexible and can tailor the tasks to best suit your needs within reason, e.g. if web design is your interest, we will focus you in that area of the business as much as possible. If general business is more your interest, or woodworking then we can focus you more on the general business tasks, etc...

A little bit about me: I have owned a few small businesses. My last business was called Natural Timber Floors Ltd and was an up-market, sustainable timber flooring business in New Zealand (I am am American, I was abroad for 7 years). It was a very successful niche business that I started and ran for 6 years. I now am a mother of a 3 year old daughter. She is starting preschool and I am starting a new business. 

While I ran NTF, Ltd, I always had interns. I worked through a program that had exchange students from Boston University in Auckland, New Zealand. I enjoyed my interns immensely and am still in contact with them. I have been given feedback from all of them that has been favorable about their experience working with my company. The consistent comment is that they learned more than they thought they would about business in general, and about the lifestyles that they want- learning about balancing life + their career- something that they had not taken very seriously until their internship. Should you find yourself interested in working with me, I will make sure that you are able to contact at least one of them, prior to finalizing your decision. 

I run my business out of a 4000sqft large home that is split into 2 sections- ½ is dedicated to the business which includes a workshop, shipping room, and the like. My daughter is only in daycare ½ a day and so patience for a toddler is a requirement! Much of this work can also be done remotely from your home (unless you are the workshop type). 

What I think you will gain from this experience is the ability to apply your skills in a real world setting, creating a portfolio for yourself, as well as obtaining a reference. I am a trustworthy reference that will keep in touch. In today's very competitive market, references are important. It is not just about the work that you are able to do, but demonstrating that people have been able to count on you. Building a 'functioning' website isn't the same as a 'mock' website that is just a pretty layout. Having a business degree isn't the same as having helped set up a real company. If you aren't too busy, why not get some experience under your belt/work to start or add to your portfolio? Add something to your resume' that others don't have. Stand out.

Regarding hours and the length of the internship- I am open to negotiating parameters based on your situation, and your area of interest, etc. . . If you think there is something of value here for you, drop me an email and let's have a chat and see what we can work out. 

Regards,

DFW, TX is a great place to start a tech company and if you're good at what you do, it doesn't cost a lot of money to get the ball rolling. I need tech people...


If you work in the information technology industry you should love what you do. If you don't absolutely LOVE I.T., you have chosen the wrong profession. This is tedious work and you always have to stay on top of the latest technology trends and how to repair that technology, security issues, web design technology and so many other things. If you're only in this industry for the money, you'll eventually get burnt out.


If you really enjoy repairing computers (laptops, tablets, desktops, workstations, servers, gaming PCs, smartphones), setting up networks, setting up security systems, systems integration, POS, building and hosting websites and all of that techie stuff, then I want to talk to you.


I've been working in this industry since I was 13 years old and for the past decade I have studied business, sales, marketing, and IT services and I need to build a team of technology professionals so we can build a new company in DFW.

I am not going to beat around the bush. I have done my home work and I know what type of people I am looking for. I am not building this business because I want to play ""business owner."" I am building this business because it is something I have worked on my entire life. I love my job, I love working with and working on technology, I love helping people.

When the consumer starts they will be instructed to use the image of a credit card that will show up on the screen and adjust it to actual size. This will be accomplished by holding a credit card up to the screen and enlarging the size of the picture on the screen until the credit card image on the screen matches the actual credit card size.

Attention Programmers:
I am a web designer, seo guy, internet marketer, and novice programmer. I am seeking a programmer PARTNER to make some money. 
About me:
I am 42 years old. Married with 4 kids. I live in a small rural town in southern Colorado. I am broke. I am humble. I am honest.
In 2005, I came up with an idea and paid a programmer to write the software. I made approximately a total of $4,000,000 and spent every last cent. I have NOTHING to show for it. I lost everything. Bad investments, 3 divorces, lawsuits, a bad business deal with a bar and some cell phone stores, etc. I was young and dumb and had lots of money to throw around. 
I am older and wiser now. I have settled down and married my soulmate. Together we raise our 4 children and live happily and peacefully, but with a tremendous amount of stress because we are flat broke and on welfare. I am trying my hardest to get out of this situation.
I have tons of ideas for money making programs but unfortunately I am not a programmer. I am very new to programming other than html, css, or php. However, I can design a super awesome GUI that is appealing to the eye.
I used to pay people to write programs for me, but I can no longer afford to do so, hence this ad. I am looking for a programmer to partner with. I can come up with the ideas, build the websites, do the seo and marketing and design the GUIs but I need someone to help with the programming part. I AM NOT GREEDY either. I no longer care about the millions like I used to so you can make a large chunk of money for a few hours of coding. 
Even though I will do 90% of the work, I am willing to split right down the middle, the profits from all projects worked on together. I used to own a pretty decent sized seo company in Texas and I have a background in branding and marketing as well so making the money won't be an issue. How much is debateable but if you know anything about software and marketing, it's a big payday for hardly any work at all. 
If this sounds like something you would like to do, please email me back or text me and we can set up a time to chat over the phone.

I'm looking to partner with a salesperson who has the energy and interest and personality to sell websites. This means identifying potential clients, selling to them, and then supporting the client through to the end of the relationship.

I'm an accomplished web developer with a great portfolio, but I don't have the time nor patience for client contact. If you do, and you want to start making 50% of our total sales on great, well-designed products, please contact me.

Since I have had sooo many awful responses, forgive me for posting a bit of information that might be helpful:

- Gmail users are not welcome to apply

- No I do not want to hire you to design my website. I'm a web developer and I want someone to handle client services.

- Please include your background, experience, and perhaps your resume.

- Be 100% sure to include your e-mail address.

- No, I will not give you a phone call. Perhaps someday, but certainly not after only one or two messages.

- It feels silly to write this, but maybe it will save me some time: if your message contains misspelled words, incorrect grammar and/or punctuation, or poor writing style, I will not reply. The person I hire or partner with will be representing my/our company, and that means you have that stuff down pat.

Colorado resident only- Seeking an ambitious and entrepreneurial spirit who knows that working for other people will never get you to the top. If you have taken the Meyers-Briggs test and found that you are a leader, not a follower, and want to do something big, then we should talk. BTW -- I am ""ENTJ"" 

I am working on building a web/app based company, but I also know I have limitations. The most glaring is a total lack of development skills -- that would be your role. 

To date I have a basic website designed (more of the art and ""look"" than anything), I have a good amount of the UI white boarded. I have quite a bit of the logic outlined, and I have the roadmap for how to get it out into the hands of the public.

What do I bring to the table? Well, the idea, which friends have said is a great one, experience in building 4 of my own companies from the ground up, many years in corporate sales and a strong business development background; hey someone has to be the idea/sales guy right! I was also a tier 3 telecom engineer, so I'm no slouch technically. More than anything I'm really good at connecting people and introducing new product ideas to the marketplace while thriving in the public interaction realm.

THIS IS NOT -- a multi-level marketing scam, weirdo crap, or product sales garbage. 
Still interested? Here are the skills that my friends say you should have: 

Knowledge & Experience
• Objective-C/Swift
• Experience building iOS apps based on best practices (and a knowledge of what those best practices are)
• Solid understanding of the iOS architecture, APIs and framework.
• Experience with Model-view-controller (MVC) architecture integration and Object oriented analysis and design (OOAD).
• Decent knowledge of networking across all layers of OSI model, including sockets, transports, and protocols.
• Knowledge of system integration technologies; SOAP, ReST, and json.

Preferred Additional Skills
• Java
• Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
• Android User Interface Guidelines
• Experience generating Unified Modeling Language (UML) Documentation.
• Experience with subversion
• Web development (HTML5, CSS, Javascript & PHP)

Personal Attributes
• Happy, Outgoing, Self-driven, big picture mentality, past military service is always a plus in my book.
• Strong analytical, conceptual, and problem-solving abilities.
• Strong written and oral communication skills.
• Ability, drive and initiative to learn and research new concepts, ideas, and technologies quickly.
• Ability to translate an idea or need into a completed solution or work product.
•	You have to want to have fun in life and enjoy the idea of being part of a business

Offered is a 40% stake in the company or an exit strategy if you choose to build it and cash out. If any of this sounds interesting, shoot me an email.

Hello,

First and foremost, I collaborate well with someone who is modest in their genius. I don't work well with the flashy or cocky personality.

My website is up for testing and works up to a certain point, then there's a disconnect between the PHP and mySQL database. It was developed using CakePHP as well.

The other day I had a meeting with a potential developer, but his skill set wasn't up to speed for where he thought I was at. He suggested I wanted to hire an Advanced Web Developer/UI with Ajax and HTML5 experience. 

This idea has great potential, but I need a working product to sell. I am interested in finding a developer who could get the current code to complete working condition, then help develop the next more robust version. 

I need to find someone who sees the potential I do, wants to make it a reality and change the advertising world. I would like to meet in person, have sign a NDA and then discuss the idea and your roll in it. Your position would be CTO. I believe this company can run lean and will run it that way until we need more fat.

Thanks for your time!

Jeremy

Looking for a local web designer that can also edit video. We're a small startup and are decently competent but we could use a designer to bring everything together and work with us on design for the long term. 

Please shoot me an email with a link your website/and or your portfolio. We aren't looking to get a big company that's going to charge a ton, in fact we prefer to work with the one man operation that is doing this as a part time gig, maybe a student, and someone is talented. 

Again, if you are, or represent a web design firm here in El Paso we're not interested :)

I need an ASP.NET SPA application using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It needs to allow a user to take a picture with their camera or to select an image. Once an image is chosen, the user needs to be able to crop the image. The image size needs to be reduced to 1024x768, at the max. Once the image is cropped and the size reduced, it needs to be passed to a Web API call. The Web API call will need to pass the image data over to ABBYY Business Card OCR. Once the XML data is returned, it will need to be parsed, and then returned to and populated onto an Edit form. Once the user submits the Edit form, the data will need to be passed over to Dynamics CRM 2016 using the Web API call. The progress should be shown after each submit. Use Font Awesome (or equivalent) as logos and icons on the pages. The site needs to perform well on desktop and mobile devices.

I have a Real Estate company that buys, and sells houses directly from owners. Therefore, I'm looking to have a Direct Response Website created that crushes any competition. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to tackle this project myself at this time. Therefore, I'm looking for someone that can provide direct, and engaging website that grabs homeowners attention. I've secured domain names, but I'm not happy at all with the current webpage design, so I want to move forward. Please advise.

Hello,
My business partner and I are looking for somebody that would be interested in partnering with us in a new website venture. We would be interested in sharing equity of the new venture or paying somebody for the work, it is negotiable.

My partner and I have years of experience in the industry we are looking to get into and have all of the knowledge to make it work. However, we don't have web design experience and have a little knowledge of SEO.

If you are interested in some paid work or possible equity in our new venture, please email me back and we could set up a time to meet.

Thanks and look forward to hearing from you!

I am looking for one or more very experienced computer persons; youthful, geek-hacker types... who are interested in helping me initially set up a 96TB Synology Nas Rack-Mount Cloud-Storage-System (I already have the NAS system operating, I am just learning how to properly use it, and I need some assistance). 

As the ""first stage"" of this project, I want to build a website for an Encrypted Email System on this server. I want to use Open-Source ProtonMail as the software for providing this email service which is available from the makers and currently posted on the Internet in beta form. The Synology NAS server I have also has web-server capabilities which will need to be implemented and DNS and domain set up.

Those people who help me will be given access to our Cloud-Storage, and our private Video Archive, along with storage for your personal stuff. The Archive also contains many Technical Books (you can read but cannot download), and possibly tutorial videos that you will be needing to work with this project. If we don't have what you need... I will attempt to get it. We will mostly be using Open-Source software, so there will be little if any cost involved therein, I hope.

You should also be familiar with setting up Apache or Sequel Databases, or help me decide which Database we will be using. As well as the Operating System for the Server is Linux, you should be familiar with. You should think of the long-term implications of maintenance of the system... not just the initial set-up. You should be able to set up a Domain from beginning to end... set up the Internet Connection to the Server and DNS, without wasting a lot of time and resources to do so. You should understand networking, routers, switches etc., (this is not a big system currently) but will likely be in the future.

You should be familiar with Adobe products, be able to set them up... and work with them easily (and tutor me) with all of the facets of web design and implementation of this system. You should have experience with necessary computer programming languages (such as Java) and those that will be needed to setup and maintain the Email and Web-projects I have planned for the future. You should be able to aggressively hack... and know a lot about security... so you can secure our web-presents on the internet against lethal attacks from desperate hackers types with lots of time on their hands to do malicious mischief.

If everything works out in the first stage of this project, in the Second Stage, ""you may be asked"" to help me design all of the websites and encryption technologies for an Online Global Directory Service and Cell Phone Contacts Management System. It would be your responsibility to translate the ideas from my head and map them on paper. Then outline the basics of the websites... the flow of data entry (the user interface), the encryption of the data on the fly, and be good with setting up a User-Friendly Interface for a good user experience that is not to overly complicated... but is eye-catching, enticing, and appeals to the geek in all of us. The future web projects will heavily work with cell-phones, data upload, download, data backup, management, and where the system will have many security features to protect the client's privacy; including our own proprietary encryption schemes with NO intentional back-doors as an organizational policy. I will discuss this more if you are the right person(s) I am looking for. 

(Consider checking out Apple in their latest court issues regarding their iOS encryption policy and NSA attempting to get them to intentionally create back-doors into their OS so they can snoop.) A simple google search will give you plenty of info on this subject.

So your intention and skills should be geared to help me with this, and for the long-haul, not just a short interlude. This will require multi-skilled, highly trained person(s) in various disciplines... but doesn't require a college degree as a prerequisite. But, it does require you to demonstrate a very intensive understanding of the most current high-level programming languages, (to decide which languages to use and implement, and how to implement them). Your programming should be sufficiently documented so that a novice programmer is able to follow what you are doing, or what is your intent. A style of writing that is imperative for others to follow, take over or debug your code.

(You should be aware of the intention and purpose of this project) 

This is the most important thing to get from this ad. 
>>> This project is eventually purposed to support some young-orphan-children in the Philippines and Indonesia with food, a place to live, and a small school; as an income-generating project. But for now, it's just an idea, with a bunch of computer parts on my floor and benches, and I am currently supporting the charitable project from my retirement income. It bleeds me every month... and I need to change this soon before I starve myself. And it would be nice if I or we can really turn this into something grand, instead of my personal pet project as it currently is.

So basically, you should be very qualified with making websites with the most current programming languages and Web Design Tools...(which I have some), and you should be familiar with state-of-the-art-data-encryption as we will be designing our OWN highly-proprietary built-in encryption into the systems. 

This will entail some networking... and helping me design and build this system, as I don't have a lot of experience with a project of this magnitude. You will be performing all your programming work while at our location... on our networked computers, and taking no part of the work outside the location. 

I am a retired mechanical designer/engineer CAD/CAM machinist. All of my experience with computers is building my own computer systems for my CAD projects. I understand proprietary operations and how to implement them. So this is a step up from that. You will be expected to help me secure this system for the new organization and on behalf of our new clients where we will be there hosting service.

""You should not expect big money from this project"", especially in the beginning, as I am operating from-the-seat-of-my-pants so to speak. You should be satisfied with getting a small amount of bean-money, and a lot of experience, in addition to an opportunity to be the future backbone of the Charitable Organization I or we will be building from the ground up. In the end... if you stick with this project, you will get plenty of work experience, and a letter from the organization stating what works you have performed, basically as a reference you can take to other higher paying opportunities. For those without a lot of practical experience to show...consider this as a stepping stone to other opportunities.

When we finally get the Organization Website up and making some significant revenue... then it will be time to talk about a permanent position maintaining the entire system. At that time, if you are still with me/us... will be the time for talking about higher compensation, or simply income sharing from revenue from the project. 

Please take note: Income sharing will only be offered to those who have the right attitude... who stick with this project till-the-end without complaining or making problems where there shouldn't be any; who show proper respect and leadership, and who contribute their time and efforts to the project without any compensation whatsoever. These are the persons who will prove themselves as worthy to share in incomes derived from their's and others (including my) efforts.

Yes, this will require you to wear many hats... and use all of your computer building, setup and programming skills to their full. I hope and intend that you are an individual that can do this. If you are not... then you aren't the right person(s) for this project.

Until this project is up and running, it is a labor of love, hopefully, we will be having some fun doing it. If you don't like the idea of working with only with a small ongoing compensation (once a month)... then please.... don't respond... this is simply not for you. This is a project that will only be attractive to forward thinkers who can see into the future, and evaluate its worth. Likely, it is more suitable for those who don't require money upfront like myself; for those who have other substance income so they aren't stressed by helping out till income is flowing from new membership.

If you require ""any"" money in the start of this project... you Will-Not be offered the opportunity for income sharing in the future. If income sharing appeals to you, you will be expected to contribute your entire efforts with this project as Meda-Pura, (without expectation of compensation)... as from the heart. No one has EVER given me a paycheck. Not-ever. And I am not complaining. Nor should you if you decide to be a long-term part of this project. Plenty of people donate their efforts to non-profit organizations all over the world... this is no different. 

Note: Income sharing in the ""operations phase"" of this project will be only available as long as you are an active member of the organization in good standing, performing some needed operations which are helpful and a necessity to the continued success of the organization. If you quit... or you are terminated for some reason, all of your income sharing benefits will also terminate. All individuals working with this project will be volunteers or contractors and not employees. To be an Employee is not an option.

If you choose that you require some compensation for the initial stage of this project... it will have to be negotiated based on your experience, and what you will be bringing to this project.

You should reply with a very detailed resume, not just a couple line request to talk or know more. Simple requests to talk show very much a lack of preparedness... and will likely not get a response from me. Those who have degrees or some college will be given a higher consideration. Your resume should list the actual experience you do have in detail. 

Hope to hear from you soon.

Your working in-house is imperative. There will be no work done from your home. And of course, a contract, and non-disclosure agreement will be necessary for this person. Please take note of this, and make available your detailed programming and data encryption experience with examples of your work.

I have a Real Estate company that buys, and sells houses directly from owners. Therefore, I'm looking to have a Direct Response Website created that crushes any competition. Unfortunately, I don't have the time to tackle this project myself at this time. Therefore, I'm looking for someone that can provide direct, and engaging website that grabs homeowners attention. I've secured domain names, but I'm not happy at all with the current webpage design, so I want to move forward. Please advise.

My business is Mobil BBQ Vending, Catering with the hopes of opening a brick and mortar restaurant. I want a trendy site that stands out from the competition. I would like high resolution wood backgrounds, with chalk board accents that make you feel warm and welcome. BBQ is old school so the the site should be as well, My logo has a very modern but vintage feel to it. I have purchased a Hive video of a hot iron brand that would need to be used in the opening page and tweaked to my liking. I want to be able to use invoicing as well as payments. All this needs to be setup so I can make changes and updates. I also use local honey and peaches from my own yard. Everything is hand made. I will also like all social media to be integrated as well as a live update as to my location for the day/week etc.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards. You can run multiple programs at a time. This isn't a get rich program but I usually get $5-$10 a day doing just this and it only takes a minute so it's a nice boost.

We are a new company ready to expand. We offer web design, SEO, content strategy, social network management and online advertising. In short we are a one stop web shop for businesses. I am looking for people, initially in the Central PA area who would like to become internet professionals and who do not mind starting out on an as needed or freelance basis.

Sales is part of the package. Income can be very good. I pay on a percentage of the job. Sales pays 20% and web design pays 50% (works out to around $50 per page. Managing advertising campaigns is also 50% (we charge 10% of the ad budget for accounts spending more than $1,000 a month and $100 a month for accounts spending less than $1,000 a month so ad management commissions are a percentage of our 10%).

We build primarily with WordPress so some familiarity with that platform is very helpful. I can't teach everyone... We create online content/sites according to Google best practices and utilize all of the currently available elements to create the best site possible for each client. Being the best is our day to day motto and we do it at an affordable price.

I plan on turning the business into an LLC shortly and at that point there may be some ownership opportunity. I would like to make the business at least partially employee owned as we go on. If you are interested please let me have a look at your resume and lets talk.

We're a three-year-old B2B company (www.risktoolbox.com) seeking help with several fully-funded internal projects. Each project is of three to six months duration.

Given the complexity of our products, successful candidates must be capable in PHP, MySQL (and utilities), and an MVC framework, preferably CodeIgniter. New grads are welcome and encouraged to apply, but due to our experience with candidates seeking jobs for which they are not even remotely qualified, we require all applicants to take an independent online test to confirm that you possess a certain level of knowledge of PHP and SQL. After reviewing your resume and a short phone interview, we will forward a link to this online test to candidates that we feel deserve further consideration. There are no exceptions to this; even our Director of Software Development has taken (and passed!) this test.

Corporate headquarters is in Parsippany, NJ, but project meetings will take place in and around Hershey, PA and online. Project work following initial introduction to our system can be performed remotely with regular communication using Skype / Google Talk and GoToMeeting.

Good communication skills are also required. To be clear: at this time, this is a contract position. Contract rate will be $25-50 per hour depending on experience. If that rate is not acceptable, please do not apply.

If you are strictly a web developer with ""a little"" server-side programming experience, please do not apply.

If you can't compose a cover letter that explains why we should look at your resume, don't apply. We receive many applications and if your cover letter isn't convincing, we will simply move on to the next resume.

Local candidates will be given priority. We've received many responses from off-shore, and you're wasting our time and yours by applying for this job because our legal protections from thievery are worthless in that case.

WEBSITE GIG FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECT;
aloha, I need someone on the Big Island Hilo area to do a pay for project job for my start up community service project.

Basically I will need;

Create about a dozen new Google email accounts

File and secure Trademarks

Choose a Web server with initial low-cost but the ability to expand instantly if this project goes viral.

Create a basic text Web Site with multiple tabs for each project.

Have each project prepared for chat room.

The most important part is to choose the website server now so that if all goes well and project does go worldwide we won't be stuck with overpriced or under performing server.

The next question would be if each and every of the dozen projects should initially begin having their own website that is linked by the tab from the main website.

Oh yes, cost at this time is an issue. I put away some funds to help make the world a little bit better place, but it ain't whole lot of dough.

This would be a do it at home project, but we would need some face time.
There probably a couple more tasks that we haven't thought of yet to get the whole thing ready to rock.
I can see this taking one or two days to complete if focused.
The time line has no date, but soon would be nice.
I'm figuring a couple of hundred dollars or so seems appropriate to make this project ready. 
More to come once were at this point.

This is a community service project called Honorable Intentions.
It would be appropriate to ask for a volunteer, 
but I'm willing to pay a little something to get it done right.

hi- my name is Robert and I'm looking for a virtual assistant to do personal projects for me. Hours per week would vary from 1 to about 4 hours, averaging about 1.5 hours/week.

All tasks would be ones you can do from home. About 90% of the work would be web-based, usually simple web research. About 10% of the work would be phone work, for example calling around to find a dentist with an opening.

The projects would generally be a number of small tasks. they are household or personal tasks that I'd like to do myself but don't have time, and I also have really bad carpal tunnel syndrome. Sample tasks:
- find good board games that are fun for 3-4 year olds.
- find a good car repair shop near my home, based on yelp etc. reviews.
- find a dentist that takes XYZ insurance and specializes in root canals.
- find the best 3 books on amazon on topic ABC, based on reader reviews

you would need the ability to make calls other area codes, and to receive voicemail from me periodically. Ideally I'd like to be able to send you new tasks by voicemail sometimes.

When replying please provide:
- Please tell me what your rate/hour would be
- On average how many hours a week could you be available for me?
- as I mentioned, this would only be a few hours per week. Is that workable for you?
- Please describe some of the web research or other related work you've done-- or provide a website or resume that does so.

Thanks-- Robert

I need an ASP.NET SPA application using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It needs to allow a user to take a picture with their camera or to select an image. Once an image is chosen, the user needs to be able to crop the image. The image size needs to be reduced to 1024x768, at the max. Once the image is cropped and the size reduced, it needs to be passed to a Web API call. The Web API call will need to pass the image data over to ABBYY Business Card OCR. Once the XML data is returned, it will need to be parsed, and then returned to and populated onto an Edit form. Once the user submits the Edit form, the data will need to be passed over to Dynamics CRM 2016 using the Web API call. The progress should be shown after each submit.

I need help with photo editing and I want my website to brand my name. On my website, I want options for prospects to either purchase health and wellness products, request services for my nanny agency (which then can be re-directed to Victorious Nanny Agency website) and/or purchase my book. I also want a tab if they are interested in the health and wellness products...an option for prospects to actually build their own business and I will coach them on how to do this. I also need a blogging site. The audience I need to capture are working or stay at home Moms, women who suffer with PCOS (poly-cystic ovarian syndrome), and christian women. In addition, I do need help with SEO and other administration duties as they arise.

We currently process our credit card payments through PayPal on our web site using php.

It's done so the user never leaves the site. We take the cc info, pass it to PayPal via curl and respond appropriately, all within our code.

It works fine.

We now want to add a PayPal button that users may also use to pay so they may have the option of paying over time.

We seek a developer who can write that code for us. We'll call your code with an array (or object if you prefer) with all the order header information. The PayPal cart will not include the items, which should make things a bit simpler. Your code will have placeholders for the PayPalAPIUsername, PayPalAPIPassword, PayPalSignature, and PayPalVersion.

We're the first email service provider to provide a one-stop shop for email coming from web and mobile applications and we're looking for some great email designers to design and develop emails that our clients will send through the API.

Transactional email like receipts and notifications are simpler than the newsletters that are blasted out from MailChimp, more focused and data-driven than message-driven. But they are also functional parts of applications, so deliverability is critical as well as being functional across a wide-variety of platforms and email clients.

Requirements:
- Strong design sense and comfort with ""startupy"" design aesthetics
- Must be fluent in and comfortable writing HTML
- Basic knowledge of web technologies
- Ability to turn around individual emails within 72 hours

Nice to have:
- Past experience designing HTML email
- Knowledge of email-specific HTML development strategies: css inling, table-driven design, etc...
- Knowledge of CAN-SPAM, DKIM, SPF and other email-specific domain topics
- Web programming (HTML/CSS/Javascript)
- Using and accessing REST APIs

No resumes needed, just provide your expected rate, number of hours/week you are available, link to or attach your portfolio, and if possible, an email you created either for yourself or a client.

I have a website that is currently being created. However, the contractor is not producing quality work, refuses to attend meetings, failing to meet deadlines, and is in breach of their agreement. I need a developer that can come in and get the layout document and complete the site. It is not a very complex site or with heavy features.

The site is 5 pages, contact us form, ticket purchasing buttons through out the site, and content. The purchasing system will be going through Paypal and Eventbrite, so I will provide the code for the different buttons we want on the site from Paypal since they will link back to that. 

The selected freelancer must be willing to sign a service agreement for the project, attend meeting dates (meetings are held over the phone, so must be able to take phone calls), stay in communication, meet deadlines because this is a tight time frame now, and show work done each day.

Let's make some green together! 

I provide optimized web content and am looking to team up with a local (preferably) web designer for upcoming projects. You and I would work together on the look and functionality of the site since I tend to be the point person with the client. 

You're the ""pretty face"" of our project so I'm looking for people with strong and distinctive creative skills to make the website look clean and compelling. I'm also looking for dependability and cost (since I'm dealing with small to midsize businesses at the Jersey shore). 

Currently I'm looking for someone familiar with WordPress and/or website design for restaurants. 

I also have a No Divas Allowed policy, so enjoy what you're doing and make time for our work together. That's the end of my lecture.

First thing first, all the members of the team are working on a volunteer basis including myself.

Looking for people who are interested in working together on creating websites, apps, etc as part of a team. Primarily I want to explore working with React Native to create iOS and Android apps. We have an app idea and a lot of the basics in place. The hope is to turn it into something to get funding and launch.

Primarily looking for people who either know React/React Native or have a background in javascript and a willingness to learn React. We already have a designer and project manager for the project and most of the early design/ideation work has already been completed.

I am willing to work with others of various skill levels, the important thing is a willingness to commit to working with the team and showing up for team meetings etc. Being that this is just a side gig I'm not expecting to take up a lot of people's free time but at the same time I can't have people coming and going on their own set schedule.

SOUND RECORDING ENGINEER / PROGRAM MANAGER

We run an internet on air radio/podcast 2 times a week in the sports entertainment category. We have grown into about 3,000 unique downloads per episode during the season this year. We are planning to double again this year. We average anywhere from the #4 to the #10 Fantasy Show on ITunes 

We have grown the last year to the point we are getting sponsor activity and need to improve our sound quality. Two people are the host for the show, and usually we have a few call in guest. One of the host lives in Danville, KY - the other in the Boston, MA area. 

We both have modern computers - - MacBook's - and each have access to a Yeti Microphone. 

I am looking for help in recording , using the proper equipment and process. As the ""Director Sound Engineering"" for us , you could be worked into the show as banter during the shows, or be a silent worker in the background. You could participate in the show. 

Our shows air on Wednesdays - 7:00 pm or 7:30 pm and Saturday Mornings at 7:30 am. They last 25-45 minutes. Once we get to July, the frequency goes up to 3x / week. You do not need to participate in the shows. Nor do you the to be present for all. 

We currently have a Web Design Glory Hound working on spiffing up the web page and need you to make our sponsors HAPPY and listeners satisfied with great audio. 

For your efforts:
1) Resume Builder for you and reference for real life work - LINK ON Web Page with your bio and credits 
2) While our revenue stream is small now, it will grow as we get closer to July - we would share all on air ad revenue with you effective immediately.
3) You could be posted on our web page as the title you select under the ""Meet Us"" 

Ideally, you would host the show ""run the board"" so to speak. Minimally you will train us and be the guru who says thumbs up or thumbs down for quality and audio. You could get involved in booking guest ,creating content, set up drops, sound effects really whatever your creative side wants.

We share profits 50/50 right after paying all expenses of advertising, taxes, and cost of materials as needed if applicable then we will share our net profit.

The site is 5 pages, contact us form, ticket purchasing buttons through out the site, and content. The purchasing system will be going through Paypal and Eventbrite, so I will provide the code for the different buttons we want on the site from Paypal since they will link back to that. 

The selected freelancer must be willing to sign a service agreement for the project, attend meeting dates (meetings are held over the phone, so must be able to take phone calls), stay in communication, meet deadlines because this is a tight time frame now, and show work done each day.

We currently process our credit card payments through PayPal on our web site using php.

It's done so the user never leaves the site. We take the cc info, pass it to PayPal via curl and respond appropriately, all within our code.

It works fine.

We now want to add a PayPal button that users may also use to pay so they may have the option of paying over time.

We seek a developer who can write that code for us. We'll call your code with an array (or object if you prefer) with all the order header information. The PayPal cart will not include the items, which should make things a bit simpler. Your code will have placeholders for the PayPalAPIUsername, PayPalAPIPassword, PayPalSignature, and PayPalVersion.

I'm looking for a web designer to help me write some custom CSS for a portfolio/cinematography demo reel website (my own). I need someone who has experience in web based video players and customizing their behavior, as most of the site is based on video clips linked to thumbnails

I'm also open to someone helping me redesign the idea from the ground up, though i figured the job might be shorter and easier if you just took the work that i've already done and customized it to fit my needs and finish the project. 

I'll pay competitive rates, shoot me an email with some examples of sites that you've designed and/or built and we can go from there, i'll send you the link to the site i'm working on and you can tell me how much work and $ you think would be involved

I am looking for an experienced programmer with web scraping experience for a personal project I would like to start. An example of a couple websites that I'm hoping to gather data from is:

http://scoresline.com/scores.asp
http://pregame.com/sportsbook_spy/default.aspx

Basically, I need the tables on those sites (all rows, headers, values), scraped and imported into SQL, including data from the past (simple date change in URL). The websites above are just two examples, but I have 3-4 more that I need scraped.

I do not have any programming experience, but I consider myself decently tech savy. Ideally, I would actually like to learn the very basics of web scraping (for additional compensation). I have MSVS and SQL, with a pretty beefy machine, and I work alongside developers at my job who can provide additional feedback and information.

Since this is a personal project, I cannot afford to pay anything too extravagant, but if you're looking for a quick project and some side cash - I think this will be a good gig.

With my budget, ideally I'm hoping for a couple hundred per site scraped, but I've never ""hired"" a dev before, so rates are definitely negotiable. I realize the complexity of the site may make things harder, but the ones I need seem to have pretty clean encoding/html. In addition, if you can spare some extra time to actually train me. I can offer additional hourly compensation. A dev buddy at work suggested C-sharp, using HTML agility pack, so if you have experience with that, that would be a huge plus!

Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and please email me if you're interested, or if you have any questions.

PS. If you are into American sports (NBA, NFL, MLB), and sports betting, I think you will find this project extra interesting, with potential financial opportunities in the future.

We are growing and we need IT Sales & Recruiting experts.
D&G Global is an IT consulting company specializes in Quality Assurance and IT recruiting.

Our Proprietary 3 Layers process is what makes us BETTER than any other recruiting company in the world - it's what will make our clients want to work with us !

It's very simple - there are hundreds of recruiting companies - but all work in the same way.
They get a requirement from the client - they look for a candidate online... they find a few available ones that fit the criteria... and they send their resumes over to the client.
That's about it !

Their filtration process is simply a set of questions they were given - but nothing technical... they simply work on volume - they send 100 resumes - they catch 1... it's based on luck.

They have no clue about the skills their clients actually need - they simply search for keywords they see in the requirement and find resumes that have those words... they email them to see if they are available and if they are willing to take the project at that location and in that rate- they WILL send their resume.

This causes the clients to get a LOT of resumes - and in fact an average client gets over 100 resumes for each role... from various of recruiters. The hiring manager need to filter them out - chose the best resumes and then schedule an interview with them...
Most of those candidate will NOT be a good fit - because a lot of them are NOT what their resume make them look like... it's fake... they have communications issues , they don't have the technical skills that their resume include... it takes a manager months & a lot of interviews to actually find a solid candidate and usually they will find 3-5 and invite them to a face to face interview.

But till they get that - it's a LOT of time wasted... due to the fact that all those Recruiters have NO CLUE who are the candidates they send... they just send a lot ... and hope that one will catch.
Those recruiters are NOT technical - they are simply reading scripts and following a certain procedure.
That is a BIG waste for the client... who is getting a lot of un-qualified resumes...

D&G Global has changed all that.
We have a revolutionary 3 layers filtration process that includes an email interview , a phone interview and a Technical interview by a REAL expert , that will verify that the candidate actually knows what his resume shows he knows... 

We do all that before we even send the resume to our clients - which guarantees a MUCH higher level of Candidates - and a MUCH better fit for our clients... which means LESS WASTED TIME for them... they learn to trust our candidates as they KNOW we KNOW what we're doing... we are TECHNICAL RECRUITERS ... we don't just send anyone !

This should sell our service by itself as no Hiring Manager wants to waste his time talking to ""FAKE"" candidates... and do tens of interviews... when we can do it all for them.

It's an EXTRA service that ONLY we provide , that should take us to the TOP of the Recruiting industry ! 

Now , who wants to join us ?

If you have a Recruiting or Sales background - this is the place for you !
You can grow here and make more money than ever before... our recruiters make the HIGHEST commissions in the market and due to our revolutionary filtration process our candidates almost never leave the client - which means you KEEP getting your commissions on every candidate you find... for MANY MANY years...

Just for example - an average rate is $100/hr , you get $10/hr from it.
An average project length is 1.5 years - which means that you'll get this $10/hr for each candidate you assign for this 1.5 years period...
IF you assign a candidate only ONCE A WEEK - you'll be making $40/hr for the first month (4 candidates).

That's $80/hr on the 2nd month , $120/hr on the 3rd month... $160/hr on the 4th month... that's $25,600 SALARY in only 4 months of work !!!
And all you need to do is find just ONE candidate in a week... our success rate is over 20% but even if we only get 5% success rate - that's 1 out of 20 candidates that will catch... it means that if you submit just 4 candidates a day - that's 20 candidates a week - you're going to get one.
And that's 4 a month... shouldn't be that hard... 

4 a month = $25,600 salary in only 4 months of work !!

I need a good independent contractor to handle Google Adwords for my web design business. I understand Adwords and I manage a few accounts, but I would rather not handle it personally in the future. I'm getting more and more requests for this service and it's getting to the point that I need to contract out to manage my workload.

This will be very part-time, but steady (& growing) workload based on the amount of requests we get for this service. If you're a freelancer who handles this stuff regularly and want some additional work, this is the right job for you. I currently work with a few other Adwords freelancers and you will be rotated through accounts occasionally to check eachothers work. So, if you have a ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach... please don't try this here. :)

REQUIREMENTS:

- Google Adwords Certification
- Experience with Google Analytics and Goal Configuration
- A/B Testing, Onsite / Conversion Optimization (with assistance from a web developer).
- Verifiable References
- Experience with starter & small-budget accounts
- Ability to speak directly to clients in a clear and concise manner.
- Please know more about Adwords than I do.

This has the potential to grow into a full time position.

Please send me your minimum hourly rate. If you do good work, I will treat you very well. You can expect higher pay over time if you're successful with our accounts. High-end consulting rates, contracts, & flat fees will *not* be considered.

I am an older college student extremely busy with school, work, and other projects, who is getting ready to graduate and I need help either transferring my school projects, or finishing and transferring my other projects onto my website alcastro.com so I can start looking for a job in my new career. 

I am looking for a web developer with at least 5 years experience BASED IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA (so we can meet up time to time) with video and audio experience working with Adobe Premiere, Final Cut Pro, and Pro Tools.

1. First finish editing a short 7 minute video which is almost completed and for which I already have permission from a list of authors to use their video work to incorporate those works into mine. Once finished you'll post this video onto my website and YouTube. Email me for a link to preview. I need this done by around April 1st.

If you do this successfully then I'll have you move onto:

2. Updating my current audio files to include adding about a dozen more of my best current broadcasts.

I need a individual who has an understanding of web coding and programming. I've been researching to top 15 social media sites for the past three months to have an understanding on what has been a flaw that they're all relate to. 

Keep in mind this is a startup of a new social media site that, if work correctly, will become a big impact by the end of 2016 the beginning of 2017. 

As this is a new startup, you'll become a partner within this idea and therefore, depending how committed you are, will archive a equal amount of income for your commitment when it launches. (this is not a pay job but a signed partnership when the site launches, more details will be provided if interested)

My background is in business side of the industry and I have one year of Dreamweaver work but I need someone who can provide exactly what the product is after.

You have the opportunity to create a social media site that will be the new form of interaction. Every social media site today started with an idea.

If your interested on joining this team and become part of the group, email me your resume within this field and or any experience that you believe will provide a asset to the creation of the product if not web coding.

THE VENTURE

We all know how popular online dating and hook up apps are and the immediate success that several of them have had already (no we are not ""yet another dating app""). Some have received huge venture capital investments immediately and others were bought up at outrageous valuations quickly by large competitors that wanted to grab their tech and market niche. Either way their founders became wealthy as a result.

We also know it's a crowded market and there are far more failures than successes. Being another dating or hook up app in a crowded market is not going to be the opportunity it was three years ago. . .

TAP INTO DEMAND, BUT OFFER SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW

Yes, the demand is huge. Dating, relationships, sex, it all has the highest demand on the internet. We have an entirely new take on the online hook up that will provide a totally new type of online and mobile app experience. We are bringing in some technology and systems that have never been done before. In fact, we say online dating and hook up only to give you some sense of what we are doing that you can relate to.

A SMALL WEBDEV APPDEV TEAM 

We are looking for a small team (2-4) mobile app and WebDev partners to join us in this venture. We have it all laid out and ready to get to the development part, which is only one of many aspects of this venture. Most of the work (all these other components required) has been done. Now it's time to program and bring it all together.

If you are an experienced developer in mobile apps, especially cross platform iOS and Android, HTML 5, etc. and / or a web developer with fast track app experience, please feel free to contact me and submit your resume for consideration. Experience with RubyOnRails or other development tools major plus. Our app must be cross-platform and web capable. It will be subscription based. Server side programming and website development are part of the mix so at least some team members will be needed in this area as well. We are looking for clean, lean code that is logical and effective and a UI that's modern, colorful, simple, attractive and user friendly. 

This is a totally new, never been done before venture that has the opportunity to really take off. An NDA will be required to discuss details. Developers should reside in Greater Los Angeles Metro, Ventura County, Santa Barbara or Orange County areas to facilitate meetings and company business. 

This position will involve partnership equity in the business with full equity share rights. Please do not contact me if you are looking for a salary gig. This is a chance to develop a ""knock it out of the ball park"" new consumer product / service as a member of a startup. It is not an ongoing employment position with an established company. Pay of course will be included as soon as funding or revenues are produced and you will be first in line for it. 

As for this venture's value to you, you can decide that for yourself. We have complete confidence in the concept, market and business model and we have been developing new businesses, startups, launches, etc. for over 20 years and have experience that specifically related to this venture.

Email me for more info and please include an introduction and some kind of information on your skills and experience. We'll start with an intro call and then an in-person meeting if all looks good.

Thank you for your time. Best in Success. . .

Web/application development company is looking for a contract to hire creative UI and website designer.

Let's cut to the chase here. Most people who say they can design a cool website or an engaging UI are pulling themes for Wordpress and saying ""Look what I did!"". We're tired of it. We get a lot of work, and we need to bring our A game to keep getting more. We already have a ton, and we want to become 10x as large as we are now. That's where you come in.

You need to be a creative talent. Not someone who can make a site look good. Or workable. Someone who can design something GREAT, that impresses our clients immediately. We have a job for a singer from a rock band that we need designed immediately. This will serve as the proof that you are what we need. To be clear - we aren't expecting free work. We will pay you what you need for this project. And for every project after that. But we need someone that can BRING IT.

Young web company looking for someone who knows how to design websites that convert visitors to customers. If you are a web designer who makes beautiful websites, that's great. But we need someone who knows how to turn visitors into customers - conversion rate optimization.

We are a very intelligent group of people who are managing a solid list of clients - and we are growing. Rock stars, radio personalities, e-commerce businesses, referral businesses, mobile applications - we do it all. The ideal candidate for this position has done website design - either from scratch or rebuilding a page that wasn't working - and can show us examples of solid conversion improvements. Showing the pages you changed and what changed is a must. Giving us details on improvements in engagement and conversion rates would be even better.

The absolutely IDEAL candidate can make these changes themselves in addition to knowing what is needed. We have developers, so it's not a must, but we feel you have a better set of tools to get better conversions if you really know what is involved.

Los Angeles local contacts are preferred, but we will consider out of area applicants with the right skills. The job is all telecommuting, so you should be comfortable getting work done relatively unsupervised. We work to get the job done - not 8 hours a day with an hour for lunch.

Please provide a list of websites worked on most recently, performance information as requested above, and your hourly rates. We expect this job to turn full time soon.

In essence,
I'm looking for a young or inexperienced smart person who is quick on his feet.

I have 15 years of experience running a Web Design business of moderate success, highly praised by my clients.
I'm willing to put aside the time needed to properly train this smart individual in everything he/she needs to know to run their own business--at no cost to them.

Essentially I'm looking to pass my knowledge on to someone that understands the opportunity and is willing to put in his time and sweat in, in order to learn a skill that can possibly fund the rest of his life like it has for me.

Ideal candidates should have very little if any pre existing html/css/php or web specific coding knowledge but should know how to code something in some language however remote and impractical.
You must really be interested in spending 10 hour plus in front of a screen daily looking at lines of code, videos that need editing, photos that need retouching, logos that need designing and so on for in the end, that is what it takes to run your own business.

What I wish to teach you is not ""specific"" as a single coding language but all encompassing.
Design, server administration, security, SEO, creative writing for the web, picture taking, filming, project management, and everything else involved with running an always evolving ""web design"" business.

There's an extra caviat too, while you learn at no cost you will possibly make some money finishing jobs I pass to you.

Surely before that happens I will have to make sure you know what you are doing, and that you can indeed make contact and handle clients properly.
Once that can occur, the idea is not for me to act as middle man but for you to handle everything your self with the leads I provided you with, and to collaborate on larger scope projects that essentially require 2 or 3 of me...

We're looking for a part-time marketing assistant for our online marketing firm. If you're interested in online marketing and want to grow in that area, then this is the opportunity for you. 

The assistant will be working in the areas of search engine optimization, online advertising, web development and content marketing

We do not expect you to be an expert in these areas, but you may well become an expert in these areas. 

If you don't know what the hell these things are, then you probably shouldn't apply for this job. We're looking for someone who has some online marketing knowledge and is looking to grow in this area. We have established processes that make our clients and campaigns successful, but not enough time to execute all of them.

That's where you come in. 

This is an opportunity to do and increase your knowledge. It's also an opportunity to grow with a company. You will be one of the first people we've hired. So with that, the more we can grow this company -- and I can grow it by freeing up some of my time -- the more you will be rewarded. 

And at the very least, you'll be gaining legitimate experience that you can apply in the future and will look great on a resume. 

Right now, we're looking for someone to work 10-20 hours per week. The hours could vary dramatically based on our workload. You will be hired as an independent contractor.

You will also be free to work from home once we've worked through some basics and gotten comfortable, etc. So there's quite a bit of flexibility, but you should obviously have at minimum, your own laptop. As long as the work gets done in a timely and quality manner, we will be happy. 

Here's the ideal person for this gig:
- has some knowledge of online marketing
- young, eager to learn and grow in this realm
- can follow instructions, but also think and make decisions independently
- takes pride in their work
- is flexible to work when there's work to be done

If you're a college student with more time and than money and the person described above sounds like you, please apply. This will be a much better experience than working at Subway. We promise. 

If you happen to have any of these skills, that would be a plus, although they're not required:
- Design
- Writing
- Copywriting
- Coding
- Anything else marketing-related

If you're looking for a real opportunity to learn, grow and advance, then send us a resume and tell us why we should consider you in the body of your email.

If you send a stock email or a cover letter that is anywhere else but in the body of the email, we're just going to delete it. 

Starting pay will be $15/hour. If you're a student and also want to earn credit, we're willing to work with your school if that's a possibility.

This person, Maria, has been ""looking for a web designer"" to ""make a wordpress web"" since at least early December 2015. I walked her through the process, and showed her some mock-ups...Maria wanted to ""sell"" her wooden necklaces on the site and also have a random blog. Fine. 

Maria keeps mentioning plugins, so I ask her which plugins she wants to install, I have some in mind, but there seem to be more plugins that she wants setup in addition to the ones I would use, since she continually asks about plugins...

Basically, because I asked her this, she told me I didn't know what I was doing if I had to ask, in a very short, and highly unprofessional email which I no longer have. This after hours of contact phone and email contact.

She keeps posting so I finally decided to just warn others because after all this time if she hasn't found someone, something is very wrong and she is going to continue to waste people's time. 

In the future if you see someone on here talking about building a ""WEB"" run. It's probably her. And if they mention""not having much money"" run whether it is her or not. :)

Hi there,

My name is Mark and i'm a ""beginning stages"" entrepreneur living here in Los Angeles, CA. I know we're all busy, so i'll get right down to the details. 

I'm currently looking for a website builder/tech partner who is willing to work on equity to help launch a new start-up. The amount of equity? I don't know. Ideally you would be able to offer value and knowledge beyond website development, but maybe you would only bring the essential technical skills, so it's hard to say. This could all be discussed a little further down the line.

So what is the company? Without going into potentially boring and excessive details, it's an online database for photographers to showcase their work to prospective clients here in Los Angeles. Sounds generic, I know. There is 100's of details, unique qualities. and ideas to expand, but that's the basic concept to help paint a picture for you right out of the gate. That being said, if you're not at least a little familiar with the photography space, this may not be the gig for you. Or maybe it is? Perhaps you're super passionate and eager to learn!

I'm not looking for a ""company"" here. I'm looking for a single person or small team who is extremely well-versed in website design, has basic photography knowledge, a savvy business mind, and most importantly, honest, motivated, and passionate.

Depending on your involvement, this could potentially be a great source of passive income. I'm looking to do some very specific testing in the beginning stages with only one website, but if it works, the plan would be to obviously replicate the concept. (I can explain more on that later) 

I'm extremely aware that I haven't gone into enough detail here to expect a thorough and detailed response from anyone. What I essentially want is to see if there is any bites at this point. If your interest has peaked in any way, or I can answer answer any questions you may have, please let me know.

*UPDATE

Please be based in LA only. We'll need to have coffee from time to time. :) Also, please put the words ""coffee-equity-startup-photography"" in the header. Everything else will be ignored. Also, (part 2), when you respond, just pick ""one"" thing about what I said in the body of the ad and respond to it, please. 

Thanks!

A white-collar professional is looking to increase exposure and attract new business locally and nationwide in at least 3 different fields. I would like to find a skilled web marketer who can design and implement a successful web marketing campaign now.

I am offering a continual percentage of my career income for every new piece of business I get, which your marketing generates; you could monitor all new clients and hours of work and we can have a written agreement for your protection. This way I feel that a web marketer would be properly incentivized and compensated more lucratively. 

The first things I need are a simple landing / capture webpage for each of my businesses (I have the content and visuals), funneling, optimization, linked-up social media presence, Google Plus/local business, etc.

Yael Consulting (www.yaelconsulting.com) is an online marketing consultancy. Our business has done well, and now we're looking for more companies to invest in & partner with.

Craigslist is a box of chocolates (""you never know what you're gonna get""), and we're looking for someone who can connect us with the right companies, or are part of the company themselves.

We're looking for companies (with a PROVEN business model & already generating some revenue) to invest in and become their online marketing partner. For any referral connection you'd help us make, we'd give you a 5% referral fee, which means that you would get 5% of our investment return just for making the connection!

As an investor:
1) We pay for ALL of a company's online marketing expenses (manpower, advertising, costs, etc.), and....

2) We dedicate our team of marketing experts to drive up website traffic, improve conversion rates, provide web dev & IT support and bring sales & profits to the next level.

We took one company's online sales from $50k to $500k a month. They benefitted, and we benefitted, and we're looking to do this with more companies.

Our return is a % of the revenue that we help create (minus fees and returns). So if we don't help the company make more money than it did before, then we don't get paid. 

We like this arrangement because it makes sure our motivations & goals are aligned with each other. We're also pretty open regarding the exact terms, as we are looking to find a deal where BOTH parties win.

Potential companies can be located anywhere, as long as they are the right fit.

The PDF here includes more: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-t1-KbpMNBnNHAxTU5ISVdzRms/view?usp=sharing

If you'd like to discuss further details, feel free to email, text or call. In your correspondence, please include:

1) short description of what product/service is
2) link to your website
3) how much online direct revenue you have generated so far in the previous year (so we know where the baseline to improve from is)

Are you knowledgeable in the LATEST website and Social Media marketing?

Can you be cheerful, motivated and quick to develop a site that will create a great income that you can be part of?

How would you like the idea of partnering up on a new website that you can create in your own spare time. Site that sells the most beautiful Canvas Art, where we provide the art and basic costs for creating the site.

In a matter of short time we can have a fun website (one of those quick platforms, like Shopify), that you can run and bring in lots of traffic and monitor to create more and more interested customers, and we will prepare the art and ship it to the art loving customers. 


We have over 20 years of experience in the art and oil paintings business. Currently we have a great line of Canvas Art paintings that we can distribute very quickly to our interested customers.



If you feel that you are qualified and wish to ascend to great heights in the art business using your web marketing skills you can call:

Hi potential marketer/web designer
We are offering a marketing sales commision partnership. We run a small local moving
company. Our rates start at 66/95 per hour. We want someone in your field with the know
how, ambition, and discipline to get us more work. We are a small business. If you do 
what you do and provide us HOT leads we will pay per lead. If you send us 'ready to sign' 
clients we will pay you the value of the price mark up. If we charge 76/105 you get the 10 per
hour. This can be as many hours in the day as you can sell. We will negotiate any long distance
commisions on a per diem basis. Something around 225 per day. A small move to Minneapolis 
pays you 225 and a large move to Arizona pays you 900 or more... Contact me via CL squirel mail
and we can discuss options and prices. If you think you can sell and market via the internet then
lets get together. We have nothing to lose but the opportunity to gain.

I've created a website named DiscoverMankato.com. I am looking for a college student to help me get the word out to local businesses in Mankato. The service is free, however, I am also offering web design on the side for such businesses. 

I am a college student myself and would like to create a partnership with another student. No immediate money will be made, but this is a lucrative business in the area because after doing some research, most businesses need a website, or their current website needs critical updates to be up to par with technology. 

Please contact me via the website I am working on. Lets create something amazing for the community.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards. You can run multiple programs at a time. This isn't a get rich program but I usually get $5-$10 a day doing just this and it only takes a minute so it's a nice boost.

Looking for help selling stuff on internet!!! I have a dead line of May, to get a lot of things done. Not enough time to do everything. This is the most important thing for me right now.

I am selling a lot of stuff on line, (one pice is over 500.00 in ebay). Got crystal milk glass, old records(johnny cash and...). Several 8 track players two are portable other is home stereo. Bradford plats, estate stuff. List goes on.
I will give % of net from sales. Most of this is researching price. So can be done at your home. I have accounts set up ( but still seem to find some issue)Pay pal, eBay, amazon.

Also there is stuff I am just giving away. Just not worth dealing with but still worth something to some one. pics are to give idea what all I'm selling. And there is more. The shed and garage also have stuff.

Picks are to give an idea what is for sale. I have two coffee machines. one is missing some face plates. both work.

I also have a web domain and web site I need Help putting the Finishing touches on. Its kinda already framed in, just needs to be finished off? like an empty house, just needs cabinets and furniture. Again I do not have the time to learn how to do, and do 4 other pressing projects at once+ keep up on the house. I can not pay to have some one do the site now. And for the most part a high school kid could do what is left on it.

We can both make some money. Also I am starting a small business, so potential for long term. What the web site and domain are for.

I have a website that is currently being created. However, the contractor is not producing quality work, refuses to attend meetings, failing to meet deadlines, and is in breach of their agreement. I need a developer that can come in and get the layout document and complete the site. It is not a very complex site or with heavy features.

The site is 5 pages, contact us form, ticket purchasing buttons through out the site, and content. The purchasing system will be going through Paypal and Eventbrite, so I will provide the code for the different buttons we want on the site from Paypal since they will link back to that. 

The selected freelancer must be willing to sign a service agreement for the project, attend meeting dates (meetings are held over the phone, so must be able to take phone calls), stay in communication, meet deadlines because this is a tight time frame now, and show work done each day.

Hi
I had bought these two software listed below some time ago to help me do the following. They are supposed to be self-taught simple easy to use. But I never had the time to put an effort to learn how to use them. I need someone who knows a lot regarding web design and web promotion, which these two software are all about, to teach me how to use them! 

1) WebPlus X7
---------------------
This page links you to WebPlua X8, the latest version. Mine is X7, the one before. I think they are identical except X8 has some added features.

Anyway, there is a video on this page and there are manu tutorials on how to use the software. I have links to them that, if we come to an agreement, I can send them to you. The idea behind buying WebPlus X7 is that I can use the software and build websites without knowing HTML.

http://www.serif.com/webplus/

2) TrafficSeeker (TS)
---------------------
Once someone builds a website, then he/she then use TS to promote it on search engine, etc. Supposedly it is semit automatic: you feed the software the info and it submits the website, builds pages, adds, meta tages, etc. and promotes your website all over the internet. Here is the link:
http://www.serif.com/webplus/

I bought the high end one The Enterprise.

IN SUMMARY:
----------------------
I undertand you do not have these software and do not know, yet, how to use them. But if you are the type of person that can figure it out in say an hour of actually using each of them and then spend another 2 hours or so teaching me whast you learnt and, together, we build a website using X7 and promote that website, upload it on my server and then promote that website we built by using Traffic Seeker.

Here is what I suggest:
-----------------------------
1) We need to talk on the phone and come to an agreement (hours, hourly rate, when etc). I prefer weekends. During the week I am running around all day as a salesman. I want to start on a Saturday fresh and spend the day learning how to use both software.

2) Once we come to an agreement, you can download a demo version (if they offer them) and go onto the training videos of X7 and I think may be TS and learn as much as possible at your home.

3) Then you come to my home (I am in Loxahatchee) on this coming Saturday 2-20. I will give you an hour on your own using my computer and opening the fully operation softwares and practice what you learns about them on the tutorials before coming to my house. 

4) Once you believe you have a grasp on how to use each of the two software, I will then take your place behind my computer, while you site next to me, and show me how to use each one from beginning to end. Of course, you and I will never be able, from a few hours, learn everything about each software. All I want to know is how to use X7 to build simple basic sites and how use TrafficSeeker on how to promote the site we built, to promote it on search engine and all over the internet.

5) I am ready to pay $15/hr max 6-7 hours. I will pay in cash after the task is done. this will include 1-2 hours at your home learning how to use each of the software from the demos, training videos, etc. and the rest at my house to finalize your learning curve on the full operational software and teaching me what you learnt.

I have a website that is currently being created. However, the contractor is not producing quality work, refuses to attend meetings, failing to meet deadlines, and is in breach of their agreement. I need a developer that can come in and get the layout document and complete the site. It is not a very complex site or with heavy features.

The site is 5 pages, contact us form, ticket purchasing buttons through out the site, and content. The purchasing system will be going through Paypal and Eventbrite, so I will provide the code for the different buttons we want on the site from Paypal since they will link back to that. 

The selected freelancer must be willing to sign a service agreement for the project, attend meeting dates (meetings are held over the phone, so must be able to take phone calls), stay in communication, meet deadlines because this is a tight time frame now, and show work done each day.

I am interested in working with a web and app designer to help me market our technology systems. I have all of the content for the site, pictures, etc. We sell interactive technology systems for just a signature. Our customers are able to control their alarm system, thermostats, lights and door locks all from our 7 inch color touchscreen, smart phone or any internet connected browser. The equipment we are giving them is not some piece of crap that no one wants. This system is state of the art and will save them up to 20% off of their homeowners insurance and anywhere from 5 to 15% off of their heating and cooling bill with our smart thermostat which all together should pay for the monthly fee. No brainer right? 

Here is why you need to be really good and a simple template won't cut it... I could do that myself. I want there to be a system in place where each of our new or existing customers will be assigned an account number. They can open an app on their phone or a web browser and sign up friends, neighbors and relatives and earn a commission or order additional products and services. I would also like to have on there a money savings calculator. This could be from other sites at first but I would like it to be ours down the road. To my knowledge no one in this industry is doing this. This app and system could potentially be licensed to other companies in similar industries. I'm willing to pay a fee to develop this technology and a commission based on sales and licensing from it. 

If you haven't done something similar this gig probably isn't for you. This is a real opportunity to make some big money. 

We have a proven system that has worked in other states that we will be growing here in Minnesota. There is no investment on your part and this is not one of those stupid get rich quick infomercial type deals. We have been in business almost 20 years, in fact I guarantee you have seen our work! We installed the cctv system that captured the video of the i35w bridge collapse. We do technology systems for homes, businesses and government and are fully licensed, bonded and insured. 

Why is this in the Craig's list gig section you may ask? We want people that are hungry to make some real money and make a difference in their customers lives. You won't receive a typical ""job"" or contractor interview with us, you will receive a ""try out"". Make the cut and you will be on the road to making real money in an up and coming industry. 

Email examples of similar sites and apps you have done, work history, etc. For the right person opportunity for advancement and a sales or marketing manager position may be available down the road.

Hi I am seeking a web developer with a design sense who can also think like a consultant. I want this person to meet me in Brooklyn on a weekly basis to help me service my clients. To start I would have 5-10 hours worth of work for you to do per week and I would ramp it up based on how we work together and your abilities. I would want you to meet up with me at this nice coffee shop near my apartment off the L train in Brooklyn (Bushwick/Ridgewood). 

Projects are mostly Wordpress. The work I have ranges from SEO, Web designing, back end development (LAMP), building servers with digital ocean, and more. I have a LOT of Wordpress work and several web designs and builds I need done. Absolutely NO COMAPNIES and NO OFFSHORE applicants. You would have to meet me in person at first but if I trust for you to work remotely we can make that switch down the line. Let me know when you could meet, how many hours you have free per week and when would work for a weekly visit (i'm flexible). 

I am extremely fair with compensation and tasks and projects will be well defined, I really believe in fair work fair pay so let me know your compensation requirements and if its commensurate with your skills and ability and is something I can afford I will gladly accommodate.

Hi, 
My name is Lawrence. I help run Elementem.com, a photography retail company in New York. 
We're looking to redesign several pages on our website, including the About Us, Contact, and FAQ pages. Currently, they're very basic pages, but we would like to change the layout, font, design, and overall feeling of them. We're not looking for anything fancy, just cleaner design, font, layout, etc. 

We're drawn to the website designs of Everlane.com, Beardbrand.com, NetaPorter, and CondorCylcles.com

We are looking for an experienced website designer, who can help us redesign some of the content on our webpages. You have experience in graphic and website design, in addition to basic html/css. If your coding experience is not great, we can find a way to work around that. Your design ability is essential however. 

We're looking to work directly with you out of our office in Midtown, NY, for a few days/week. We'd like to fix 2-3 pages, and touch up some photography content on the site. 

Please contact us only by responding to this post, phone calls will not be responded. Please include a cover letter, your portfolio, and your resume.

Pay will be determined based on your experience, between $15-35 per hour.

Thanks so much,
Lawrence

I'm an Independent FilmMaker and I'm launching an Indie Film website in May or June of this year. The mission of the site will be: 
""To Provide the tools and community to be a successful indie filmmaker in NYC and beyond""

Right now, I have the domain name and web hosting. I'm likely going to use a WordPress theme to build the website, but I'd be open to other options, depending on what you recommend.

What I'm looking for is someone who is an Indie Filmmaker themselves, and also has skills building and helping maintain a website about Indie Filmmaking.

This is a part time project for me as I both work a full time gig and try to produce my own films. The ideal person would be someone else in the same situation who can help with the website side of things and become a partner in this venture [including sharing any accolades and profit that comes of it]. 

What that means is that, in the short term, I need someone who can help me grow this idea into a business that can pay off in the long run, but who can also afford to commit to the project without pay, at this time.

So, if you're interested, I'd love to hear from you, and I can go into further detail about what I'm looking to accomplish, what plans I have for content and how we can grow this into something that also becomes a self distribution network to get our films in front of a built in audience.

The Process: After your initial consultation with our creative team, we sit down and map out an 8-week agenda based on your needs. The project plan is quite comprehensive since we really focus on the quality of work we produce with the artists. 

For example: If you're an artist that knows a producer, or already working with a producer and don't really need music production work from FFP, we schedule the project all around your own productions and give you a quote excluding music production costs. 

The Artist Development program generally includes a 2-3 track EP/Demo (music pre and post production), website design and development, 2 months of social media growth, 1-2 photo shoots, and custom design work (logo artwork, single/EP artwork and social media cover artwork). All of the above are included in the full package. A project of this capacity would rough take about 8-12 weeks since we focus on quality over quantity.

Hi, I am in the process of creating a website which counters the mainstream media lies on Donald Trump. I already have a spectacular domain registered, but I have zero web design experience. The site will be relatively simple - listing each of the lies, followed with the truth as a counter. Needs to look professional and have decent graphics. It needs to be set up to be easily updated every day.

The campaign is just beginning. Once Trump wins the nomination, the lies will be daily. If you've been following the campaign, you know how much he hates the media. I will do my best to promote the site through social media and SEO optimization. Perhaps Trump himself and the campaign may take notice of the site. Lots of opportunity here to be a part of something huuuuge.

My business is Mobil BBQ Vending, Catering with the hopes of opening a brick and mortar restaurant. I want a trendy site that stands out from the competition. I would like high resolution wood backgrounds, with chalk board accents that make you feel warm and welcome. BBQ is old school so the the site should be as well, My logo has a very modern but vintage feel to it. I have purchased a Hive video of a hot iron brand that would need to be used in the opening page and tweaked to my liking. I want to be able to use invoicing as well as payments. All this needs to be setup so I can make changes and updates. I also use local honey and peaches from my own yard. Everything is hand made. I will also like all social media to be integrated as well as a live update as to my location for the day/week etc.

Good morning.

We are looking some off-site SEO work to be done.

We are not looking to hire an SEO company on retainer, or any recurring billing plan.

This is a gig paid on a per-job basis. This is not for a 6 billion dollar SEO company, obviously.

You will be paid per set of 100 social bookmarks posted.

The bookmarks must be on your own accounts, not shared accounts or accounts accessible via a subscription or software you purchased. Again, you must OWN your accounts yourself.

Preferably, each avatar is a fully developed persona, and your bookmarking accounts are not spammy, organized, and topical niche feeds.

Presently, this is all we need. However, we are engaged in dozens of projects and will certainly be working with SEO contractors in the future. This is a 1099 gig, not a salaried position!

Please leave your name, company, link to web site, as well as your direct email and/or phone number.

Also please place a bid for the work. Your bid will cover 100 social bookmarks, drip fed either manually or posting software. Also state the total pool of social backlinks that you own.

How much work will this be? I would venture to guess quite a bit. Payment preferably via PayPal, but may also be via mailed money order.

Thank you!

Looking to create a new website. Our old one is giving trouble.
Please reply to this craigslist ad for the link to our current site and a more detailed list of what we would like. 
Background Information: 
1- We have been using wordpress for about 2 years. Have custom code for our scheduling because it is so specific. However, every time we update wordpress, the code breaks and we then have to pay the third party developer our last site developer hired to fix it. This is both annoying and expensive. To this end, we stopped updating and now our site has been hacked and we wish to scrap it and start fresh.
2- We generally like most of the functionality of our current site, with the exception of our scheduling system. When people want to schedule an appointment, they need to choose both a pick up and a drop off. However, this is not done on the same page. They do one first and then are taken back to the same page to put in all the same information again for a drop off. This is a nuisance to our customers. This means that they will get 2 different confirmation emails and so will we. This clutters up our inbox and can sometimes result in missing appointments. 
3- We accept payment via PayPal and currently have it set that when we put up an invoice, we can send an email invoice to our customers so that they can pay. They also have the option to add a tip to the payment. We want to keep this. 

Thanks for your reply!

Looking for somebody to create a brand new website for a laundromat. People should be able to schedule pick ups and deliveries on the same page, according to a very specific schedule. 
Here is a list of things we currently have and still want along with things we would like added. 


Scheduling 
1- When people schedule, it needs to be 2 hours in advance. So if they are on at 9 am, the earliest appointment they can get currently is 11am. We want to keep that. 
2- Orders have a 24 hour turn-around time. If we pick up at 3 pm, no one can pick a delivery time before 3 pm the next day. Delivery time has to be the same time or later than the original pick up time. 
3- If people choose a pick up for between 8-9 or 9-10, they can choose a same day delivery (4-5 or 5-6). Any slot after 9 does not get that option. 
4- CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE: sometimes we would like to be able to close off certain parts of the day. The only way to do that is to go through the customer side of things and keep scheduling appointments until the time slot is closed. It takes 3 appointments to close off a time slot.

We like the idea of a drop down menu for the scheduling portion of the page which includes: 
Dropdown menu 
Pick up day and time -Time slots are one hour time frames (8:00-9:00 am, 9:00-10:00 am, etc)
Drop off day and time (same page, 1 email confirmation with appointment details included).
Currently, these are the fields on our scheduling page (minus the apt #. This, we want to add.)
Fields for input: 
First name
Last name
Email (email format required)
Address (including zip and apartment #)
Phone
# of bags
Payment method 
Cash/chk
Credit

Hey there,

I am in the conceptual stage of a web site startup and will start by divulging two very important facts that will likely weed out many who read this:

1) I have zero website development knowledge/experience (Weebly is about as far as I've come, used as a brainstorm platform)

2) This is (at first) an unpaid position that, for the right individual, will still be seen as a valuable investment of their time; one that could likely turn into a paid position/partnership when the site gets to the point of launch and is able to be presented in regards to the acquisition of investment funds for growth. 

3) I'm not necessarily looking for a seasoned industry vet but rather anyone that has the capabilities/resources to consider dabbling in this project with me.

4) I know my case is essentially a dime a dozen (confirmed by some feedback in a couple responses) and only expect someone to consider this project IF they find the heart of it intriguing - not if they are just looking for a 'new' project or side project to fill some time. 

With all of that said, my web-based concept will provide a very simple solution to a nuisance/problem/cost experienced by a wide range of individuals (especially the initial target demographic). The reason someone with no internet/computer background is getting into this industry is due to a 'light bulb' moment I had last summer that sparked a flurry of brainstorming to solve a problem that came up during my recent travels. The value of this concept will be most easily understood by someone who enjoys outdoor recreation, travel, action sports, etc. A business plan is in the works and a handful of investors within my network have expressed interest in seeing the final proposal.

I am looking for someone to help turn what is currently on paper into a viable 'prototype' site that can be used to a.) generate initial interest, user counts and feedback and b.) pitch the concept to those that have the funds to enable us to take the site/company to the next level. If you think you might be that person and you have a few hours per week to put into an exciting/fun project that has great potential, I would love to speak with you. I'm happy to hear from anyone who is in NH or in any other state for that matter - this isn't something that necessarily has to be discussed/worked on in person.

If interested please provide:

- Some basic info about yourself and your hobbies (like I said, I want the right person to work on this project and that person is one who shares the same interests as myself and my target demographic).

- Experience (school, training, certifications, etc.)

- Portfolio (links to sites you've built or helped to create)

- Favorite National Park/Forest (or the next one on your list to visit) - why?

Lastly, you would be required to sign an NDA before any further details would be divulged.

If you've made it this far down the post, thanks for your interest!
I'm looking forward to hitting the ground running with this concept.

Feel free to email anytime, with something interesting in the subject line!

Take it easy.

So this is another one of your usual ""Do work for me and Ill pay you eventually!!!"" posts that tends to pop up every once in a while, but there's a bit of a twist.

So whats the twist?

The biggest difference would be that I'm not a designer, or a businessman with a ""Million dollar idea!"", looking to recruit free talent. I'm an professional engineer who's been working on a project for the past few months and I'm starting to suffer from serious mental fatigue.

The second difference is that I'm not going to promise the project will blow up, or make you rich. Obviously I think there's a chance, but by the best of measures when looking at the ratio of ""Brilliant Ideas"" to ""Successful Entrepreneur"" any startup is a long shot. 

The third difference, is that while I cant afford a long term paying position, I actually have resource capital to get something off the ground. If it looks like the project might move, I can invest the money into a dedicated server and host the project in house.

Why do I need help then? 

I'm currently working 40-60 hours a week doing development at my full time job. I close my IDE, leave work, go home, open my IDE, and start working. I'm tired, and I'm worried about getting sloppy and making mistakes. I've invested a lot of time and money into this project already, and I want to see it through with pride and the knowledge that I carried out its implementation to the best of my abilities. I'm beginning to second guess some of my design choices (back end) and thats never a good sign. I need a second set of eyes.

What do I have to offer? 

Not much. Time working on a fun project. Experience with a code base (mostly) developed to the standards you would find in a medium to large business environment. A bit of mentorship, and code review free from judgement or fear of consequence (though I will roll back your changes if you fuck up). Experience with industry standard software. Maybe the occasional beer. A shiny new web site to list on your resume, and a reference that will accurately reflect your skill level when you leave the project.

Do I need a new developer? Not really. Honestly I would be better off with an experienced developer that I can also learn from. Unfortunately, I have nothing to offer an experienced developer with a full resume and no need for references and experience.

If you 

A. Are interested in what I have to offer
AND
B. Are motivated, and have free time 
AND 
(C. Have web development experience and would like to learn more MS technologies
OR
D. Have experience with MS technologies and would like to learn more about web development)

Then shoot me an email and we can see if this is something we can make work.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards. You can run multiple programs at a time. This isn't a get rich program but I usually get $5-$10 a day doing just this and it only takes a minute so it's a nice boost.

The site is 5 pages, contact us form, ticket purchasing buttons through out the site, and content. The purchasing system will be going through Paypal and Eventbrite, so I will provide the code for the different buttons we want on the site from Paypal since they will link back to that. 

The selected freelancer must be willing to sign a service agreement for the project, attend meeting dates (meetings are held over the phone, so must be able to take phone calls), stay in communication, meet deadlines because this is a tight time frame now, and show work done each day.

ATTN PROFESSIONAL WEB DESIGNERS!!!!

You guys need to realize that the going rate for website designers is $45 per hour. Stop responding to ads that offer $10 per such as the one I am referring to below. If you are a professional web designer, chances are you have spent over $40k on learning your skills. You are not going to make a return on investment if you keep responding to these ads that offer $10 per hour. Let your work speak for itself and demand no less than the current going rate for a web designer. 

It is time that we stop these ignorant people that should not even be in business. A serious entrepreneur has a business plan and the funds to complete a project. Also, an entrepreneur that has a business plan is more successful than the one without one.

As an advertising company that publishes ads through the Google AdWords network, we are ready to buy your Google AdWords account. 

You have a Google AdWords account if you have a Gmail account.... probably without even knowing you had it! If you are not going to use it to advertise as an online publisher, you could get a quick $50 via PayPal by selling it to us. 

An example of your Google services are--- Google+, YouTube, Google Drive, Google AdWords, and many, many more services offered by Google. If you never intend on becoming an online publisher then you will not need your Google AdWords account. 

That's money you are leaving on the table or on the World Wide Web.....instead of putting it in your pocket via PayPal! 

So how does this work? We want to purchase your Google AdWords account, if you can meet the requirements listed below:

1) You MUST be located in the Orlando--Central Florida area with a Gmail email account that's at least 3 years old. If it is 3 years old or older then you are eligible for this opportunity. Every Gmail email account is entitled to several services or products provided by Google, as mentioned above.

2) You can access the account from a laptop or desktop with your own internet connection.

3) You have the JoinME program or can download it for free from the app store or through the Join.me website onto your laptop or desktop 

4) Through Join.me you provide the login that allows us to access.....then watch and control everything we do as we release your Google Account from the AdWords Account associated with it! 

5) You could sign into your Google account and watch us switch out the AdWords from your Google account. (Usually takes about 7-10 minutes---so please have at least that much time to watch the process through Joinme). You watch from your screen as we re-assign the Google AdWords, releasing your Google account from it and get $50 for a few minutes of your time by selling us the Google AdWords!

6) You can provide us with the PayPal account that you want us to deposit the $50 at the end of the call to. You will confirm you have received the $50 deposit in your PayPal before we end the call.

Once we have administrative access to the AdWords account, it will have no relation with your inbox or Google account at all. None of your personal data like emails, Google+, YouTube, etc. will ever be involved or compromised, they are completely separate things. We will unlink you completely from the Google AdWords account and change the Google AdWords name in the account to our company's name. You will have no relation with that Google Adwords account anymore.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Why we are doing this? Because the more accounts we have, the more ads we can publish. Simply put; it's like more billboards on the highway gets more exposure. Kind of the same thing happens with AdWords, it's a numbers game.1

Why don't you guys create more Gmail accounts from your home? Because Gmail requires accounts that are real; Google is an awesome company that is smart enough to tell if the accounts were recently created for the purpose of publishing ads on Google.

How long will it take? The whole process from JoinME access to navigating through Google to PayPal deposit takes about 15-20 minutes!

We are looking for someone familiar with building and uploading Apple mobile applications to help us fix an issue we are having. The computer in my office has gotten out of sync with it's certifications or distributions... I'm not sure. The issue is that the person who used to do this job is no longer with the company and nobody here knows how to do this. Although I'm a techy guy (web), I'm not this kind of techy and can't seem to figure out how to resolve the issue. What I'm looking for is someone to come to our Aston R&D facility and take a look at the issue I'm having. Happy to compensate you for your time, even if you take one look and say ""can't help"".

Also looking to start a relationship with an Apple iPad application developer for occasional contract work and updates to existing applications. I'm the creative/online marketing person within the Marketing Department so you'd be meeting with me initially. The Senior Director of Marketing might also want to meet you if we decide to move foward with things.

Hello people,
I have a website idea that I would love to see created into a real business. I'm looking for a web designer that can team up with me to bring this vision to life. I have told a select few my ideas for the website and they are all excited about the potentional of what this website will become. Like I said I have the vision and ideas to make this idea become a reality but the only thing I'm missing is a web designer to create the website for me. 
This can work two ways....
I can pay you to create this website if you charge a reasonable price, or if you believe in my idea enough to want to become partners and we build this business together, let's do it! What I can bring to the table is the vision for the website, the ideas for how the website will grow and make us a lot of money. I'm also a hard worker and good at promotion. I can bring a lot of traffic to this website with all the people I know through networking. I just need someone that has the knowledge to build a website and keep it maintenanced and I will help add alot of content to it.
I will tell you the vision I have after we talk on the phone and come to a understanding of what direction we both want to go into as a team to build this business.

Once I find the web designer I'm looking for I will delete this post. Thanks

• All work needs to be done in person so we can have the back-forth necessary to quickly turn around projects. We typically work at locations in Delco and Montco.

We currently process our credit card payments through PayPal on our web site using php.

It's done so the user never leaves the site. We take the cc info, pass it to PayPal via curl and respond appropriately, all within our code.

It works fine.

We now want to add a PayPal button that users may also use to pay so they may have the option of paying over time.

We seek a developer who can write that code for us. We'll call your code with an array (or object if you prefer) with all the order header information. The PayPal cart will not include the items, which should make things a bit simpler. Your code will have placeholders for the PayPalAPIUsername, PayPalAPIPassword, PayPalSignature, and PayPalVersion.

I run a seed-funded startup in the mobile voice space and I am looking to grow my team in sunny Gilbert, AZ.

We are doing things that have not been done before in an area that has an improving market that will touch both the consumer and enterprise markets. I need team members that want to stretch themselves, learn and have expertise in the following areas:

UI/UX Design: with prototyping (Proto.io, Marvel...) and app animation walk-through experience. Must also have great experience with material design and animated ""delightful"" transitions.

Mobile application development: Currently developing for Android and responsive Web but will move to IOS in the future. Must have experience in using Git and experience in working in an integrated DevOps environment. Looking for LAMP engineers for the current iteration, but the employed engineers will have input and feedback on application architecture as well as development toolsets. (RoR, Bootstrap, ...)

Web Development: Need experienced developers with responsive design background, strength in SEO and an ability to reproduce UX designs to the pixel. Development will include some animated transitions, and other active components of a very high-end modern site. Design elements will include material design, so any familiarity with developing to that will be helpful.

Hey there. 

I'm a web dude. Been in the game a loooong time.... mostly working for clients. Over the years I've come up with many business ideas that are either on a burner or that I've been working on as side projects. I've got a large list of great domains, and some (very serious) larger projects that are itching to be launched, and it's time to start materializing. 

I just don't have enough time and energy to tackle everything on my own anymore... I have clients and a family. And frankly... I'm getting tired of working for clients. I want to work on building a digital products/services empire! But to speed things up, I need a partner... someone like me. Someone who knows their stuff and has some real experience. I've worked with some of the best marketers and businessmen - big fish, and learned a lot... so I have a lot to offer. You'll see!

My skills include:

- Application Architecture
- Business Processes
- Marketing (seo, sem, smm, ppc, email, and more)
- Sales (landing pages, conversions, email systems)
- Analytics
- Design
- Development
- Databases
- Servers
- And more...

I've helped build multi-million dollar businesses from the ground up. I've designed and built many systems by myself... from website builders, to ecommerce platforms, to business applications, servers, API's and sooo much more. It's always been for someone else though... no more!

I'm looking for my counterpart. A partner. I've had a couple over the years, but none of them came through. I always got stuck doing everything... either because they didn't know how/what to do, or just kindof sucked at doing it. And me... honestly, having to do everything all the time... wearing all the hats, I get burned out. But, this doesn't mean I'm not a do'er. I do. I just need someone reliable to split the workload with me, and of course... the profits, too! 

I need someone who has SKILLS + CREATIVITY and a good sense of modern style. Someone who puts QUALITY + DETAIL right up there on the priority list. Not just someone who THINKS they can, but DO.

The right person will:

- Be LOCAL! Phoenix (areas)
- Be able to launch a WP site quickly (load the right plugins, theme config and tweaks, etc)
- Be able to design graphics, quality/modern graphics
- Be fluent with CSS/JS (jquery, bootstrap, etc)
- Be fluent with PHP/MYSQL (oop, db design/query/etc)
- Be familiar with Git
- Be familiar with a php framework... Laravel is a huge plus.
- Be AVAILABLE and REACHABLE... not just once in a while, but more often than not. (IM, SMS, Phone, Email)
- Be FAST at what you do. this comes with experience... so I expect you to know your stuff very well
- Be updated with modern tools and practices for front-end... speed, optimization, minification, mobile, caching, etc.

How will this work?

You and I will need to talk. Start off with intros. Go over our backgrounds, projects, etc... that's how we scope each other out. If we both feel like we could make a great team... we'll join forces. This will be done officially... with a binding contract. One to cover my ass, and yours. I'm not going to divulge all of my ideas, inventory, assets, etc... without some kind of protection.... NDA/Non-Compete...etc. and you won't have to either. If we mesh well, we can put together a deal between us, and we'll also specify our roles and shares. 

Once that's out of the way... we can start talking business. We'll go over some of the ideas, I'll share my thoughts, listen to yours, and we'll bounce back and forth to come up with viable plans. Then we'll decide what plans to attack first. The goal is to start building a network of money making sites and businesses. Take on one project at a time. Get it done, rolled out, pushed and once it's producing, move to the next project.

I have projects that range from a few days of work, to months of work. Working from the small to large will build up resources for the larger projects. Each one of these should produce well. I'm sure you'll agree. And hopefully you've got some potential winners, too!

This will be a two-way street. Work with each other.. for each other, and try to get to financial freedom ASAP! I will rely on you to evenly share the workload with me. This goes from planning, to development, to design, and on to marketing. A-Z!

So... if ^ is YOU... get in touch. Reply... send me an email and give me a quick overview of you... and DO include some of your recent works. Be sure to include a way to contact you as well.

I look forward to meeting you... partner!

Are you an entrepreneurial minded web designer/developer, but you don't want to become a business expert, marketing manager, and all the trappings that come with running an actual business yourself? 

Are you entrepreneurial, and feeling frustrated by going from project to project in an endless cycle of having to find new work to do and get paid for? 

Are you desiring to get beyond scrambling and getting paid by the hour for projects and wish that you had projects that kept paying you long term? 

Are you able to work and get things done within timelines and deadlines? 

There is good news then, because my company has a unique opportunity for you. We are experts in business operations, management and master marketing strategists who desire to build some membership forum websites that cater to niche markets that will pay memberships to be a part of our forums. These will be unique and low cost, and offer niche community benefits that free sites don't offer that we will market. 

These will be cookie cutter sites, low maintenance. You will develop them. We will bear the marketing costs of time and money to get them fed with the right members. We both will benefit with long-term residual profits. 

If you are interested, please DO NOT send a resume. Expertise in setting up membership forums with paid membership integration necessary. 

Write a brief email back with a description of your experience, perhaps a link to a site you developed, and a way to contact you. We will be in touch for a phone or Skype chat to go over more details and see if we are a good match for each other. 

Mutual confidentiality assured.

I am looking for 1 individual to partner up with on an idea I have. I am currently a graduate of Penn State with a 4 yr degree in IST, minored in networking. I have been out of the field for some time, so I am looking to partner up with someone who is fresh with the latest languages and coding. 

I do not want to waste my time with someone who doesn't know how to make websites, or create what needs to be done here. We will meet up somewhere public to discuss everything in extreme detail before forming our partnership.

Individual must:

- Have good knowledge of the latest web design tools
- Have something to show (degree, past work, portfolio, etc.)
- Have time to work on this project (I am not asking for 40 hours a week, but you will agree to show progress of work in a meeting (skype or face to face) every two weeks until project is complete.

You will not be receiving a check, or payment for partnering up with me. When everything is complete you WILL be receiving a percentage of all earnings made. This is NOT a scam site, or a site like that. This website will be related to competitive video games. Similar sites have made close to 12k/day, however there is no website with my exact idea so we will be unique and one of a kind. 

I can see potential for an APP to be made in the future as well.

Please let me know if you have any more questions, or would like to apply for the partnership. I am VERY easy to work with, and will be more than motivated to compete this project.

I am a longtime freelance copywriter who regularly writes web copy (Home, About pages), blog material, editorial copy and short form sales letters and other ads for clients worldwide. 

I'm looking for a web designer who'd like to trade doing a new website and blog for me in exchange for my writing services. 

It seems like a good trade -- you don't pay a premium for a professional copywriter for your next project for a client, and I get a site that I can use for my future business purposes. I'm not talking about setting up e-commerce or anything; just a simple site with a few portfolio pages and a blog feature. Preferably using the WordPress CMS but I'd also be open to Wix or others. 

Ideally you're a diverse web designer with experience building sites for small businesses, and you're located in the Portland area so we can meet up. 

Who knows -- maybe it will turn into a long-term partnership in which we refer each other to our clients!

I hold a B.A. in English and Journalism. I started out as a college reporter and then worked as a TV news producer for about five years before moving into being a freelance copywriter, travel writer and sometimes video producer and journalist for the past six years. I've run a blog on Blogger for the past six or so years and I make some money from it every month, but I'd like to take it to the next level and start getting some real traffic. 

If you're interested, let's talk about an arrangement. Introduce yourself, tell me about your experience and why this work trade situation appeals to you. I look forward to hearing from you!

I am looking for a charismatic sales person to help land website design and development gigs for me. 

My main focus is on web design + development but also work with print and digital design as well.

I find that most of my time is spent working on design and not leaving much to acquire new clients...this is where you would come in.

I don't care how you approach prospective clients as long as it is in good faith and you represent our company with integrity and keep in-line with our brand. We are honest, transparent and hard-working and this must be represented in all sales processes. We work primarily with small businesses.

I am willing to pay 20% commission on all completed sales. Our average sale is ~$2500 ($500 commission to you).

You can choose your hours and location. I am looking for clients nationally, so focus does not need to be local. 

We will meet weekly (via Skype) or occasionally in person to discuss new products, areas of focus and how we can streamline processes to make both you and me successful. 


Requirements:

*Internet access
*Sales experience (preferred but not required)
*Know how to find leads (I can show you how I've done it in the past)
*Social Media savvy
*Honesty and Integrity are part of your character
*Genuinely want to help people
*Outgoing and friendly
*Ability to ""shake things off"" and understand that you will get some ""no's"" but the ""yes's"" are so worth it
*Ability to follow directions and understand we do not have any tolerance for any shady business deals
*Fun, easy-going, organized, and eager to make some money.

I am fairly easy-going and want you to be successful. I am open-minded and willing to work with you on flexible work arrangements.

1. Name
2. Phone number
3. Best time to reach you
4. Experience

I am developing a concept that incorporates web/IT technology.
Are you knowledgeable and skilled with web/IT technology.
Are you at an entry level seeking to expand and learn more web/IT technology.
Do you know at least one area moderately well and you stay current with changes and updates.
Do you have some interface familiarity with a few other web/IT tech areas. 
Then I need your help.I need your skills and counsel to help with a concept I have.
You do not have to know a multitude of different platforms,stacks and technologies,don't think anyone really does. 
If you are a zen master developer,I can't afford you,so I won't ask.
Besides if you are a senior developer with a high skill set,you probably are very busy,in high demand and not even reading this ad.
Also No jack of all trades~master of none.

But if you have a technical understanding related to at least one key area of web/IT technology.
You have and work with software tools for efficiency and analysis in that area.
You are familiar with web/IT companies that implement a particular type of tech. 
Such As:

~ DNS Web Security ~
- Spoofing/Cache Poisoning - Domain Hijacking - DoS - Frame/Bandwidth/Clickjacking - Cloud Flare - Threatpost - PEN Tester - Blackhat - HTTP/2 - OpenDNS - XMLhttpRequest - Cookies - OAuth - Sysinternals - SQL Attacks

~ Programming Paradigms ~
- OOP - Declarative - Dynamic - Static - Lamda Calculus

~ PHP/Ruby ~
- Script Optimization Tools - Zend - Pear - CakePHP - PHP.net -

~ Web Structure ~
- MVC/MVP - AngularJS - BackboneJS - EmberJS - HTML5 - CSS3 - SEO Metadata

~ Engines ~

- Normalizing - Optimization - MyISAM - innoDB - Backups

~ Software Licensing ~

just to name a few.
This project may interest you.
Again you DO NOT have to know all this ~ just a key focused area.


*NOT SEEKING*

~ Compiled language developer.
~ Java developer.
~ Mobile tech integration or app development.

This project could be of interest to a motivated self learner with a creative entrepreneurial spirit.
A developer building a professional portfolio may be interested.
A college student studying software development may find the project interesting.
If you do dry utility type web/IT development and would like a creative side project,there could be a fit. 
If interested send a link to an online social profile,so I know who you are.
If you have links to any web/IT development work you have done,or you are presently working on,send that.
If you state that you know a particular web tech,you need to define your skills.
If you DO NOT send a link of some type,I will not respond.

I will respond back with a website link that has more info about the project.

The webmaster has me downloading 29 images in full size and then converting them to 600px longest side for a product image, and 250px longest side for a thumbnail image. He then sends me these videos 

https://recordings.join.me/8ngSI0MuaUaHWyZc8dnlKA
https://recordings.join.me/GhU1RBPKf0efZdt-lr5UvQ
https://recordings.join.me/sAmImUqoJk6zB0EPSdruiA

These videos don't explain anything. He is showing a completed excel, not a workflow TO complete the excel. Such as, do I have to go to Redbubble and find each direct product link and manually populate the excel with.

Also, the excel only has two image files. Tutorial 1 shows three image files, 1000px longest side Design (original), 600px Products image, and Thumbnail. The excel has a thumbnail image which matches and it has a Page Image which it doesn't say if that is the Design image or the Products image. Regardless, where is the third image?

Can someone help me implement what this web designer has charged me for but not provided a full roadmap to complete?

I need a streamlined workflow to give to staff so that they can go on about making each excel file for hundreds of these. I need a way to grab each link and match them. He doesn't even address this in the videos, he just assumes it is completed.

The project would be good to help display your skills.

The project would be good if your pursuing a career as a professional developer.

~HTML5
~CSS3
~Javascript/ECMA
~Object Oriented Programming
~AngularJS/MVC
~Facebook API access. 
~ReactJS
~jQuery

You do not have to have a full expert understanding of all that is listed.
But you can't be on chapter two or three of Javascript For Dummies.
Having the motivation and desire to learn more within your skill domain is a must. 
web/IT technology is not going away any time soon.
It is a creative and interesting field to get involved in.
There is good job security in web/IT.
And there is a growing shortage of skilled developers.
If your committed to web/IT development,I want to help and work with you. 
You need to have good communication and social engineering skills for the project.

If interested send a link to your Facebook page.So I know who you are.
You need to define what your developer skills are.
Put some basic info about your developer skills on your FB page or create a separate page to highlight your skills.
The project actually relates to this process.

Hi! I've used sites like weebly.com to build websites that look good. So I need your help to take my skills to the next level. I'm building a site for my new start up company. It should be super simple but I've hit a snag with certain things. Bringing you on would be 2 fold- so you can save me precious time with your knowledge base, easily directing the build. And also helping me conceptualize the framework and making it look sharp! 

This should not be a hard job or take long if you are a skilled web designer. I anticipate using a site builder where I would manage all changes after it is built. 

Timeline: 10 business days maximum 
Hours: about 2 hours per day working together at local Starbucks 
Pay: $20-25 per hour based on experience
Ideal start date: This Thursday March 24

Please respond with your resume and links to completed websites or a portfolio. 

I'm very excited to complete this website with the right designer. It should be fun!

I need an ASP.NET SPA application using AngularJS and Bootstrap. It needs to allow a user to take a picture with their camera or to select an image. Once an image is chosen, the user needs to be able to crop the image. The image size needs to be reduced to 1024x768, at the max. Once the image is cropped and the size reduced, it needs to be passed to a Web API call. The Web API call will need to pass the image data over to ABBYY Business Card OCR. Once the XML data is returned, it will need to be parsed, and then returned to and populated onto an Edit form. Once the user submits the Edit form, the data will need to be passed over to Dynamics CRM 2016 using the Web API call. The progress should be shown after each submit. Use Font Awesome (or equivalent) as logos and icons on the pages. The site needs to perform well on desktop and mobile devices.

Hello!

My name is Jackson Rodriguez and I run a local web development company that matches qualified freelance developers with prospective clients. We have been doing this work for a couple of months now and have a very dependable ten man team who are always eager for new work!

Together we have built iPhone applications, custom WordPress websites, developed software and whatever else our clients have needed. We provide comprehensive reports, 24/7 customer service, and a number of options to help your business grow!

We work with a number of different companies and other freelancers in two primary capacities:

1.) Ghost Developers - If you have a job that you don't have the time to do or the price point is too low, send it to us! If you give us the price point, the details, and information we can take care of the work for you and return it to you with a completed project. You can send it to the client and take all of the glory. We get the portfolio and everyone wins!

2.) Recommendations - The other way we work is by taking direct recommendations from you. This is great for graphic designers, freelance sales people, and whomever else may have access to leads. Basically, just introduce us to a perspective client with a recommendation and we will pay you cash for it! 

I understand that there will need to be a trust built between us before we can keep working together so take us for a test run! We will give you a discounted price for the first project to prove our ability to communicate, deliver, and provide top quality service! So, that is the offer I wanted to make today! Please, send me a message or give me a call if you are interested and I look forward to doing business soon.

This gig is a commission-based sales job. Unlike most sales job, selling for my company is unusually easy, because of the type of business we do. Literally any business or website owner is a potential client. 

We offer copywriting services to established businesses, startups, etc. We offer whole-scale web copy revamping as well as guest blogs to improve a website's credibility and it SEO.

The job consists of posting ads for us, seeking out leads, and messaging leads. If someone responds to an ad you posted and it turns into a sale--that gets a commission. If you get someone on the hook and I close the sale--that counts as a commission.

I will explain more to you about how our business works, what the hook is that makes us an easy sale compared to other firms or freelancers, and I will even share with you some example ads. I will let you know our rates as well so you can calculate your potential commissions. 

Serious inquiries only.

Work Smarter - You've Already Tried Harder - Your Talent and Brains are guaranteed to You make more money working for yourself, doing something that you will love.

Web Developers/ Designers/ SEO's / Engineers - get going now to develop alternate income quickly - Web Design & Development is a Saturated Market - Good Clients are getting much harder to find - Good Clients are fewer and far between. Web Guys have all the tools to make far more money in far less time with no hassles and no stress.

We all Love Web Design & Development, but it is changing - Clients offering lower hourlies and lower fixed flat fees. Leaf Blowers now get a higher hourly than a good Web Developer. Very sad.

Developers, sincerely, have You noticed that New Client Acquisition is more difficult and takes longer no matter how great your portfolio ? Have you noticed new clients seem to have less money, smaller budgets ? Have you noticed More Prospective Clients more prone to hire less capable, less experienced, less talented, lower priced developers ? More Clients telling ""how I got screwed over"" stories to get your price down ? Have You noticed that New Prospective Clients are willing to take the risk of believing lies by hustlers on lower price web sites, almost like they want to be lied to ? So you tell the truth, show them high quality portfolio and they pick the newbie, hustler, for less than half your fee. And the ultimate Horror for a Developer, is that more Prospective Clients are asking you to "" do a free mockup"" for me = ""show me what you will design"" for me ? Ultimate Horror is working for free or working for a Broke Client.

Work Way Smarter Not Harder - the Sooner You Start the Sooner You Grow Your New Income !

Trade Options for independent income, no selling, no client pressures - if you are an Engineer, Web Designer, Web Developer, or SEO Specialist, you already have what it takes, to easily generate independent income, part or full time - believe me. Use your IQ to make your own money. You already have the tools to succeed, your computer, your high speed/broadband connection, and your God Given Talent & High IQ. Use Your Brains to Make the Money You Deserve to Make.

Get Coached to Trade Options - 20 to 80 % Returns per Trade.

Past Few Weeks Actual Trades:

Wed Feb 24 bought SPY Mar 185 Puts @ $216 each
Wed Feb 24 sold same SPY Mar 185 Puts for $416 each so $200 profit on each (92 %)

Fri Feb 25 bought SPY Mar 195 Calls @ $253 each
Tue Feb 29 sold same SPY Mar 195 Calls for $330 each so $77 Profit on each (30%)

Wed Mar 2 bought SPY Mar 198 Calls @ $239 each
Friday Mar 5 sold same SPY Mar 198 Calls for $392 each so $152 profit on each (64%)

Tues Mar 15

Bought SPY Apr 204 calls @ $195 each
Bought SPY apr 203 calls @ $206 each

Friday Mar 18

Sold SPY apr 204 calls@ $300 each so 54 % profit
Sold SPY apr 203 calls @ $384 each so 86 % profit .

This is a very conservative trading style designed to preserve capital and make consistent profits you can count on. This will make you a very good trader in a very short time.

Most of My Clients only need the basic four hour session ($240) to learn all of the below quickly:

1. learn to trade gaps with options - make a quick 30 % to 60 % profit per trade.

2. learn to recognize a few simple patterns that will make a very quick 30% to 70 % profit per trade.

3. learn to trade by remote, and make profits even if you work full time or cannot trade during market sessions.

4. learn to spot the options ""tells"" after hours and pre market so you can be ready to take your profits quickly.

Anyone can learn to trade options without all the time consuming mumbo jumbo - to simplify your trading style, to focus on one thing, making money with very little risk.

Learn how to fix your account, definitely switch from day trading stocks to day or swing trading options and you can heal your account quickly. In fact I would advise anyone who is trading stock to switch over to options NOW for two very important reasons;

1. More Leverage with Far Less Risk.
2. Higher Probability of Making 20 percent or more easily.


One on One Coaching via Skype to trade equity or index options to generate a part time or full time income at home on your own computer. If you have any trading experience this technique will be very easy to master.

Hello, this is just a good will type request. I am not a web professional, but I have had a couple of simple websites, one for an actual bricks and mortar store. I have a site that I ""may"" try to develop into an online shopping site. I've had a free blog type site up there to keep the url fresh on the web for a number of years, and I do get traffic. My analytics are not the best, using Webalizer through my host IX Web. It does provide a bunch of data, which I can read. But what I really want to know is line by line, is this valid, is this crap, what does this actually mean, is this decent traffic or really not? Again, I can more or less get the gist from the report, but I don't have industry experience to have any sense of what it actually means. Would anyone with any good knowledge about this be willing to take a quick look at my report and give their 2 cents? Many thanks.

We are looking for an excellent editor to update professional speaker profiles on our website. This is a remote project and can be done from anywhere with a computer and Internet access.

SKILLS NEEDED

Writing
Copy editing: spelling, grammer and structure
Detail oriented
Web research
Data entry
Basic HTML
Simple photo editing

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The job entails utilizing an online database via WordPress to update speaker profile records. There are approximately 1,100 speaker records total to be updated. It usually takes about 15-25 minutes to update a profile. A sample speaker profile page can be found here:
http://speaking.com/speakers/joseph-stiglitz/

Procedures for updating a speaker record are:

1) Log into our back-end online WordPress database from any computer.

2) Locate the most updated speaker profile information on the web: usually at the speakers' personal website or other websites with speaker listings.

3) Copy and enter new information found on the web into the database fields. Profile data includes: city, state, summary description, profile, books, programs, photo head shot and video links. 

4) Simple HTML added to the profile, client testimonials, books and programs page. 

5) Resize photo and upload using the Wordpress ""add media"" interface.

6) Find 1-2 speech videos for speaker (on YouTube or Vimeo) and copy link into a database field.


PAYMENT IS FOR PER RECORD UPDATED

$2 for record.
$2 additional for each bio, program outline, book and program page. Total possible is $8.
$1 for each video link added.
$1 for new photo added.
Total for each complete updated speaker record would be around $12 each, depending on how much info is updated in each speaker profile.

If you are interested, we'd be happy to send you more information and to set-up a call to go over the project in greater detail.

Please send a resume with cover letter with any experience you have in web content management, editing and/or writing.

Thank you for your interest and we look forward to hearing from you.

Together we will be creating a web-based business; email me for details. It will take us on the order of four to six months to get this going, but once it is running it will be a low-maintenance business with tremendous potential.

Requirements:

*Must be able to make a strong commitment, especially over the first few months.

*Must have the skills required to create a website, as well as apps for iOS and Android. 

*Can outsource labor and hire additional help as needed, and as we can afford. 

*Must have a renegade-type personality. I'm looking for a Machiavellian motherfucker who would have no problem making money, for instance, by encouraging and enabling the masses to (legally!) exploit weaknesses in large bureaucratic systems. 

We will be in this together, so there will be no pay at first for either of us. We will earn what we can make. Tell me a bit about yourself, and send over a resume if you happen to have one on hand.

Are you knowledgeable in the LATEST website and Social Media marketing?

Can you be cheerful, motivated and quick to develop a site that will create a great income that you can be part of?

In a matter of short time we can have a fun website (one of those quick platforms, like Shopify), that you can run and bring in lots of traffic and monitor to create more and more interested customers, and we will prepare the art and ship it to the art loving customers. 


We have over 20 years of experience in the art and oil paintings business. Currently we have a great line of Canvas Art paintings that we can distribute very quickly to our interested customers.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards. You can run multiple programs at a time. This isn't a get rich program but I usually get $5-$10 a day doing just this and it only takes a minute so it's a nice boost.

This individual must have some free time and enjoy small jobs. I am looking to work with this individual to open a business doing web design and social media marketing. Primarily, we would use wordpress based websites for businesses, community groups, and individuals.

I would do much of the coding, structure, SEO, speed, and analytics setup and would need a graphic designer to fill in where I lack skills (artistic). We would offer logo design, pictures for the site, etc. I have experience running and managing a small business and have no problem with getting clients, although we would discuss initial marketing strategies as well and act as a local group, meeting the client at their place of business to assist them in creating, re-creating a website. I would eventually like to expand to include other related services such as app design and virtual assistant work, but for now I would like to focus on web-based marketing.

Please send an example of your creative work and approximately how long it took you to complete that work with your phone number to the email address listed above. I will meet with you and discuss what the next steps might be and see if you are interested at that point.

As a 33% - 50% owner, you would be getting paid directly from the business or we can set it up so that you are a sub-contractor depending on your preference.

Many supplements that are touted to increase cognition, focus, alertness, or well being are grouped under this vague blanket statement.""

THE POTENTIAL
Nootropics are becoming safer, more effective, and better known, due to the widespread popularity of the new CBS TV series, Unlimited.

Those who are smart enough to become established with a customer base early on are going to see unbelievable growth over the next several years.

I need a good independent contractor to handle Google Adwords for my web design business. I understand Adwords and I manage a few accounts, but I would rather not handle it personally in the future. I'm getting more and more requests for this service and it's getting to the point that I need to contract out to manage my workload.

This will be very part-time, but steady (& growing) workload based on the amount of requests we get for this service. If you're a freelancer who handles this stuff regularly and want some additional work, this is the right job for you. I currently work with a few other Adwords freelancers and you will be rotated through accounts occasionally to check eachothers work. So, if you have a ""fake it 'til you make it"" approach... please don't try this here. :)

- Google Adwords Certification
- Experience with Google Analytics and Goal Configuration
- A/B Testing, Onsite / Conversion Optimization (with assistance from a web developer).
- Verifiable References
- Experience with starter & small-budget accounts
- Ability to speak directly to clients in a clear and concise manner.
- Please know more about Adwords than I do.

This has the potential to grow into a full time position.

Please send me your minimum hourly rate. If you do good work, I will treat you very well. You can expect higher pay over time if you're successful with our accounts. High-end consulting rates, contracts, & flat fees will *not* be considered.

Searching for a web design professional to migrate my Squarespace e-commerce site to Wordpress with e-commerce through WooCommerce. I will be switching the store to a multi-vendor marketplace using the theme ""Handy"" created by transparentideas. 

This gig will include:


The bulk of the work will likely be copying products from the old site and pasting to the new. Not too difficult but just takes some time I need to spend on other things. I estimate 6 hours of work and am offering $150 for the project. Would like to have this completed by mid-day this Sunday. If interested, please send resume and link to portfolio with past projects along.

I've got some web and graphic design background, but I haven't done much work on responsive sites. I'm not stuck on any platform (I originally intended to use WordPress, but I'm now open to using a good web template or another platform like Squarespace).

I'm an established web designer looking for an established marketing counterpart. I've got a healthy client base at my disposal, and am looking to expand my offerings with a few experts that can supplement what I already provide. 

My goal is to find someone that is already doing this successfully, and is willing to work with me to form some effective marketing packages that actually drive traffic + business, or provide value in some other way. 

Right now, my regular ""package"" includes web design, and laying the groundwork of a professional online presence, and my goal would be to find someone that could transition it into a ""marketing"" phase seamlessly, as we launch the new website. 

Ultimately, I'd like to find someone that knows local optimization at a high level, and someone that is really good on the social side. Also someone that is a PRO at PPC. 

I'd like to work out some offerings with you with a healthy % for each of us, add you to our ABOUT page as an expert in your area, and then start integrating your offerings into our services.

I'm located in Concord, and it would be nice to find someone in the East Bay but anywhere in the Bay will ultimately work. I've been in business for 5 years, have grown a bit each year, and plan to make 2016 the year where the company becomes bigger than just what I can provide. 

If you are interested, please reach out with a quick note about what you bring to the table. Looking to find some people that work at a high level, and can show real value.

Please read before responding:

This is not an offer or a position for employment. This is an at-will/on-demand arrangement where you would be operating solely as a 1099 independent contractor.

This position is perfect for someone that is operating their own computer or tech consulting business and wants to pick up a couple of jobs on the side.

I'm looking for an experienced IT consultant / field technician that can help with on-demand work.

I strive to schedule jobs with as much advanced notice as possible. However, there will be a small percentage of calls that may require same-day service. 

To be a visible candidate you must have the following experience/skills:

- Experience with both Windows and Macintosh platforms
- Experience with iOS and Android mobile devices
- Virus, Malware, Adware and Ransom-ware removal
- Wired and Wireless Networking (working with consumer routers, access points and switches)
- General Internet setup (DSL and Cable Modems/Gateways/Routers/etc.)
- Experience installing, terminating and testing CAT5/5E/6 and RG6 cables for both telephony and data applications
- Audio/Video Gear Experience
- Software based data recovery
- E-Mail Setup and configuration (iMAP/POP/Hosted Exchange)
- Network File Sharing & Printer Setup
- Experienced setting port forwarding/port triggering rules and open firewall ports on common customer premise equipment
- The ability to disassemble and repair laptops (specifically Dell and Lenovo Thinkpad products)

Extra Credit Skills (nice to have, but not required):

- Proper OS re-imaging techniques (Ghost, Acronis)
- Captive Portal / HotSpot Projects
- Experience with configuring Video Surveillance systems (NVR/DVR) to stream video, and/or the willingness to learn. 
- NAS setup would be helpful
- VLAN configuration would be helpful
- PTP VPN would be helpful

You must have excellent technical and people skills. This will be on-demand in the beginning and hopefully evolving into something consistent as we move forward. 

My customer segment is made up of residential, small businesses and high net-worth individuals. 

As a 1099 Independent contractor, you will need your own tools and equipment. We will sign a non-compete agreement.

You are free to work other jobs and/or operate your own company as you see fit. 

The work is located throughout the greater San Francisco Bay Area. Most jobs are on the Peninsula, but there are some in other various Bay Area cities.

Candidates should be located on the Peninsula or in South Bay area. This opportunity just doesn't make sense for individuals living in the East bay or other remote locations (Antioch, Berkeley, Oakland, Martinez, Mill Valley, Hollister, etc., etc.). 

Please do not respond if you are not located in the greater Peninsula or south bay area, don't have a car, have an 8-to-5 type of of job or if you do not have a skill set that matches the above. 

NOTE:

I am NOT in need of a Web Site Developer / HTML or PHP Coder / Word Press guru - or - an online referral based company. 

I simply have no needs for this skill. Submission/responses of this nature will be deleted.

Please have some type of technical certification (A+ or some other tech certification)

E-Mail me an introduction and provide me your technical background (or resume). If there a fit, I will arrange for a phone discussion, and if warranted, an in-person interview.

We currently process our credit card payments through PayPal on our web site using php.

It's done so the user never leaves the site. We take the cc info, pass it to PayPal via curl and respond appropriately, all within our code.

It works fine.

We now want to add a PayPal button that users may also use to pay so they may have the option of paying over time.

We seek a developer who can write that code for us. We'll call your code with an array (or object if you prefer) with all the order header information.

This is ideal for freelancer or web design students that are savvy in HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. I am looking for someone that can do it within 1-2 months development. Contact me through CL if your interested, we can meet and talk about it furthermore.

Thank you

2016-03-18 8:55am,"
The last time we posted, we got several responses. In the middle of fielding those applicants, we solved our primary issue of our new ASA firewall.
After watching 15 minutes of youtube videos, we figured out how to do it in 40 minutes. Yet, we were getting quotes as high as $1200 to do something in 30 minutes. We need to be a bit realistic here.
I am expecting 4 hours of work.

There were a few good applicants but scheduling issues and some can't work on-site.




We need to migrate our PIX firewall configuration to our ASA firewall. We are planning an upgrade with AT&T and our old firewall is insufficient.
The main issue is we needed SPF connectivity. We have it running in a closed network for testing but it isn't configured properly.
We like a consultant to use our PIX as a reference and supply us with a startup-cfg and running-cfg that we can load on via TFP.

We are very technically inclined but this is not our areas of expertise. Do not ask us to email you our CFG. We need an onsite face-to-face vetting. If we like you, we may hand off our running-cfg and you can work on it in a corner of our office.
We don't expect this to take long. The first time we had our original firewall configured was 10 years ago. The freelancer went in from scratch, looked at our old sonicwall and banged out a cfg in 3 hours total including the interview/questionnaire time.

The setup is very simple. WAN/DMZ/LAN
We have multiple hosts on DMZ as we have 1/2 an IP block that we use to host www/dns/mail/etc.

DMZ is 6.1.1.0./25 
LAN is 192.168.1.0/24

Some LAN ips are seen as outside servers as DMZ addresses.
Then we have some VPN group/tunnels.
NOTE: We need just the basic setup. We don't expect a line-by-line copy of our old PIX running-cfg. The total PIX line count is 932 lines.
We are getting quotes based on line count. So we will eliminate that requirement but slimming it down to the bare-bones.


The bulk of content of the PIX are static routes like this:

MOTD and a bunch of GroupObects we may not need anymore.
A lot of this can be trimmed down as we want to clean a lot of the cruft that has accumulated over the years - VPN access for freelancers/old vendors.

So we don't expect a line by line copy. We only need a handful of this configuration to get us started on the GUI so we can see the differences. We will then fill-in-the-rest.

We have some static routes like the one above where the majority is our DMZ and a handful are LAN that are accessible to outside world
static (DMZ,DMZ) 6.1.1.55 6.1.1.55 netmask 255.255.255.255 
static (LAN,WAN) 6.1.1.63 192.168.1.246 netmask 255.255.255.255 
So the outside world may will see 6.1.1.55 which may be a web server.
They also see an internal box of ours as 6.1.1.63


This is about 300 lines. Again, we don't need 300.

Then there are the services for those groups.

In them there IPs of our various servers. Again, I don't expect all the groups and IP.
Just a handful to get us started. Once we see how it works in the GUI, we can do the rest.

The same apply to our VPN. We have 3-4 groups/tunnels with less than 15 users.
We only want 2 groups to get us started (admin/freelancer).
The VPN network pool is a 10.x.x.x network


So we only need to see a handful of these copied over to get us started.

A few notes and things we like to have:

1) We have a SPF and ethernet WAN (WAN/WAN2). We like to have a file for both to swap. So the static route all point to WAN (our SPF) but also like w/ Ethernet [WAN2] so we can test on a Saturday downtime. Basically swapping out our live one to test if everything works and proceed.
So this is just a copy-n-paste.

2) We like to somehow test in a closed off environment.
I have a laptop w/ the IP of our AT&AT Gateway. I can ping it from the new Firewall and I can see the link. But when I plug another machine into the LAN, I can't ping or access port 80 of that pseudo test gateway.

So we like to be able to plug in machines to our DMZ and see traffic between WAN,LAN,DMZ.
So this is a NAT/Service rule in our close lab environment. When I feel that things are working, I will actually test live on a Saturday/Sunday morning down-time. The goal is to a lot of conceptual testing before physically plugging it in our real network.

Next,

3) Advise us on possibile things we can do with our new box. Can we do something like fail2ban or packet inspection denial.

For example, if someone is connected to a SSL server with anything lower than TLSV1.2, they are denied access. But we would allow VPN/restricted IP groups to use it.
We have some old servers that we are patching and want to block that kind of traffic for audit/compliance.

The other thing nice to have is the ability to monitor certain traffic request without any detriment to the performance. So if a hacker tries to hit 2-3 web servers looking for
/wp-admin/ /phpmyAdmin/, basically looking for a web back-door, we'd like to block them for an hour. Or if someone is trying to use SMTP without AUTH, we immediately block them.
This is like fail2ban that we run but I'd like to move it to the FW.

I don't know if these are possible and we don't urgently need these two task at this moment but we have more work in the future for this kind of consulting.

Hi there,

I am looking for someone to work together with me to finish a website. I am a computer hardware/software tech and am starting up a small business in technical support/computer repair. Website design has not been my specialty since HTML 4.

I am somewhat well versed in HTML5, PHP, XML and CSS but I would like to get my site up and running within the next few days and I just can't do all the editing myself. I am basing my site off of a CMS platform, I have made some progress in both Drupal and Wordpress, but have decided to stick to a primarily wordpress based platform.

I am a photographer and graphics designer, in addition to being a A+ and Net+ certified computer technician; I also possess degrees in computer science and administrative justice. I can work with the latest versions of Photoshop and Illustrator. I would like to work with someone IN PERSON (SF or greater Bay Area) at my home office or at a public place/cafe (I have mobile 4G XLTE) to finish up this site and get it published.

Please let me know if you are interested.
I can offer hourly pay, trade/barter for goods and/or services, and/or individual/brand endorsement.
Thank you for your time.

This is a rewards site that works well with an autoclicker (I use GS autoclicker- http://gs-auto-clicker.soft112.com/- but any that lets you record multiple clicks should work). Works best with the nGage and the ""best of the web"" offers on the main page (listed under earn easy sb with sponsored videos), but also works with discover offers, encrave and videos (best for videos through the swagbutton). Just run through it once to set it to click the right spots and then just let it run. You can run multiple at a time. Earn points and redeem for paypal or gift cards. You can run multiple programs at a time. This isn't a get rich program but I usually get $5-$10 a day doing just this and it only takes a minute so it's a nice boost.

Looking for a programmer who can quickly do the back end programming for a new metasearch engine, most of which will be similar to Dogpile, WebCrawler, MyWebSearch, etc., but with several dramatic, fundamental changes. 

Our plan is to create the best meta-search engine website on the internet, for a particular niche, with a special design strategy and an extraordinary marketing strategy that will insure we crush the competition. We need this site up as soon as possible, so that we have something tangible, operational, and excellent to show investors. Then we will seek at least $50K-$100k in financing, over a few financing rounds, mostly for marketing the site all over the Internet. You get paid $2000 as soon as we get financing. 

But also, as part owner of this enterprise, you will profit in the tens of thousands, at the very least. This is the best business plan we have out of thousands of solid plans, and the profit potential is beyond huge.

This job description is literally what a nightmare client would request. I don't usually take the time to respond to these posts but as a web developer with over 10 years experience and at least 2,000 websites under my belt, I just had to.

1. These are NOT minor site adjustments....a minor site adjustment is changing some text, adding a photo, maybe a minor CSS change....""add a payment gateway to accept all credit cards""? a payment gateway, paypal? Amazon? Stripe? authorize.net? hahaha... setup and testing alone is a few hours minimum IF you have no problems to begin with. You are after all being trusted to handle other people's money

I can go on and on about every single demand in this post, but it speaks for itself. People who have no idea what it takes to put together a site usually have unrealistic expectations. I assume the 1 days pay is about 200 bucks or so? I would have my junior developer work on this project for no less than 5k, 4k for the actual amount of hours/work and 1k just for the headache this person would bring to the project.

I guarantee this will be posted for months.... lol

Fellow developers beware!

• On the page where it says FOR TEENS (where the girl has TWO buns on her head) you will need to resize the first after photo which is on the right side. It is cut off too much. I will send you the pictures.

Hello, i own a small restaurant here in Camarillo and my website needs updating. I have done all my own web work and it was fine back in the day but now with everyone using cellphones and tablets, i want to make it more responsive. I also would like to make it more interactive. I've already begun the process but would love to find someone to share ideas with and re design it together. Im pretty young, and id say more knowledgeable about webdesign than the typical business owner but was hoping to find someone that sees this as a hobby and can maybe either meet up with me and work on it together or if you prefer on your own thats fine i guess too. i just want to be a part of it. If this seems like something your interested in let me know. 

I feel like this would be perfect for someone who is still in school and is still learning about web design and needs a project to work on their skills.

Let me know if you are interested in helping out.

The technician must be able to recognize circuits such as Cable Modem, DSL, T1, etc. Technician must have a laptop and be proficient using the command prompt, web browser, MS Word and MS Excel. Technician must have a camera (cell phone is ok).

Pay is NET10 if you send us an electronic invoice such as QuickBooks, PayPal, Square, etc. The terms are NET10; however, once we receive all the deliverable documents we usually pay the electronic invoice immediately. In other words, if you send all the deliverable documents that are completely and properly filled out and an invoice that gives the option to pay by credit card - I pay you immediately with a company credit card.

Deliverable documents are as follows...

1. Completed IRS Form W9
2. As-Built Drawing (by hand is ok) showing where all existing and new equipment is located
3. Signed Work Order (provided by us)
4. A picture of each device worked on - sent by cell phone is fine

Pay is $50hr plus a $25 one way trip fee.
There is NO time limit for the site visit(s). We would rather this project be completed correctly not quickly.

There will be multiple dispatches to the same facility. We will be installing IP Cameras, WAPs, racks, and electronic equipment. There is a help desk to call to be walked through any difficulties.

I am a full-time in-house web developer for a very reputable design and marketing agency based in Northern Virginia. I am looking for an experienced web designer that would like to team up with me and seek out some paying gigs to make some extra money.

Ideally, you would be employed otherwise for your main source of income, and we would take on projects when both of our schedules allowed. Hopefully you have some existing sites that you have designed out on the web that you can show me. I have dozens of live web sites I can direct you to that illustrate my coding knowledge. It would be great if you also had experience working directly with clients. Design naturally has a lot of back and forth with clients, so your communication with them should be very open and prompt.

If it matters I'm 28 years old and have been working full-time in the web development field for 5 years. Bonus points to someone around my age that enjoys the occasional (or frequent) happy hour.

I am looking for people, initially in the Central PA area who would like to become internet professionals and who do not mind starting out on an as needed or freelance basis.

Sales is part of the package. Income can be very good. I pay on a percentage of the job. Sales pays 20% and web design pays 50% (works out to around $50 per page. Managing advertising campaigns is also 50% (we charge 10% of the ad budget for accounts spending more than $1,000 a month and $100 a month for accounts spending less than $1,000 a month so ad management commissions are a percentage of our 10%).

We build primarily with WordPress so some familiarity with that platform is very helpful. I can't teach everyone... We create online content/sites according to Google best practices and utilize all of the currently available elements to create the best site possible for each client. Being the best is our day to day motto and we do it at an affordable price.
